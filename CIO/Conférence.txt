The covid-19 crisis led us, among other things, to make two things:

1. **Make school when schools are closed** and therefore resolve a paradox. In addition to that we had to ask ourselves how to deliver the better experience when it comes to remote learning (in my opinion this is an ongoing process)
2. **Rethink our definition of school**. Everyone saw an opportunity to express the way how the crisis could reshape the school as we know it or on the contrary how to preserve what school should be away from a screen and from the giants of the Silicon Valley.

We’ll try to give a quick view about this but in the meantime I would like to say that the pandemic made possible an exciting experience maybe an unprecedented one for the educators we are.

I’ve read a lot during the lockdown (and by a lot I mean a lot) and most of the time what I read was mostly complains: schools are closed, we miss the pupils (rarely the colleagues), parents and teachers and students are overwhelmed, a screen is not a school, remote learning is a Trojan horse and Californian company will from now on rule the world and so forth. While some of these assertions may be true, I just wanted to say that we have an opportunity to create what we think school might be and with a little optimism express our dreams not our nightmares. In other words, we have work to do because everyone agree on this: the world without a vaccine will never be the same and we’ll have to deal with the virus.

# A paradox: school without school

It’s a paradox because while brick and mortar schools are closed we still have to deliver school. Moreover it breaks the way we understand what school is. We often (too often?) think school as we see a [tragedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_unities) from the 17th century: unity of action, unity of time and unity of place. 

# A new definition of school

The pandemic crisis led us to improvise and find new ways to deliver school. Teachers wound up to rely on:

- Autonomous students which have to organise their own timetable, their own schedule
- Parents. They are usually told by teachers: let me do the job, I’ll take care of everything. Well that is not true anymore. We have no one to watch the student make his homework 

In addition to that, we all have been thinking a lot during the pandemic. I’ve been collecting a tremendous amount of articles expressing fears, hope, ideas and suggestions. During the pandemic it has been a very interesting laboratory of ideas about school.
