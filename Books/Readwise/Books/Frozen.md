### Highlights

- One winter day, Elsa and Anna were playing in the snow. Elsa used her magical ice powers to make it snow in their room and created hills and slides for Anna to play on.
  Anna was running through the snow, jumping all over the place. Elsa was having trouble keeping up with her. She slipped on the ice and fell on the ground, but Anna made another jump high up in the air.
  Anna: “More, more! ...Ahhhh!”
  She tried to save Anna by making another hill for her as cushion for her fall, but instead, struck her with her power. Anna fell to the floor and passed out.
  Elsa: “Oh, no! Anna, I’m so sorry!”
  Elsa quickly ran towards her, tearing up because she knew she had failed to protect her little sister.
  Their parents quickly took Anna to a special doctor, who erased the bad memory along with many good memories with Elsa.
  Anna was left with a snowflake-shaped scar on her forehead.
  Elsa’s powers would only grow stronger, which could be harmful to the people around her.
