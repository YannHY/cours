### Highlights

- Online learning needs to provide opportunities for building community, without it, students are simply learning on their own and no one wants to pay a premium for a youtube version of education.
- The highest level of learning according to Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy is the ability for learners to create. Instead of thinking that the end of a course needs a final exam, we should seek instead to allow opportunities for learners to create something new with the knowledge that was given.
- Your job as the instructor in this digital age is not to know it all, but rather to help your students critically decipher what knowledge is best to be utilized via the internet. Digital literacy should be the bedrock of every online course and allowing for exploration will help you the instructor navigate this new normal with your students.
- discussing what the end goals should be
- More time needs to be spent focusing on how you can get learners doing and less time reading/listening.
- Give yourself room within your digital course to allow your students to explore the content, but also additional opportunities to let your students contribute to the course as an evolving space.
