### Highlights

- I thought that last role would be a funny casting coup if I got it: Carrie as Carrie in Carrie. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0141ZP21G&location=242))
- Of course, most people want to be liked, I think, especially when you consider the lonely alternatives. Even the fringier members of society—gangsters, drug cartel types, garden-variety serial killers—even they want to be liked in their own endearing ways. They might want to be admired for their own particular brand of impressive awfulness, such as managing to elude the law for longer than anyone in their questionable line of work, or for the unique and even striking manner in which they slaughtered their victims. Clearly there are numerous methods that can be employed in one’s ravenous quest to be loved. ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0141ZP21G&location=577))
- I fell in love with London while I was at school there and have never fallen out. I love their being as bound up in their history as they are, preserving their buildings instead of razing them to the ground to make way for another big beige building with lots of windows to throw yourself screaming from. I love its accents, its exchange rates, its idiosyncratic friendly behavior, its museums, its parks you need keys for, and its colas without ice. If I can forgive a place for not making ice a priority as part of their lifestyle, that’s true love. ([Location 698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0141ZP21G&location=698))
- “I don’t know how anyone can drink alcohol, just based on the taste,” I said. “It’s like rust. I’ve seen people swirl wine in their mouths with delight and it baffles me.” “Me, too, luv,” one of the crew replied. “I’m in it for the effect is all—screw the taste.” “Yeah, but when I was young, it looked so great to me—people standing around in clusters, drinks in hand, heads thrown back in wild laughter—and I just couldn’t wait for that to happen to me. I couldn’t wait to learn the secret of alcohol that unleashes all that gaiety from deep within. But it was ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0141ZP21G&location=711))
- a lie, a horrible, horrible lie, and someone is someday going to have to pay for it.” ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0141ZP21G&location=715))
- There are some things that I still consider private. Amazing, isn’t it? You would think, without concentrating too hard, that I consider whatever I said and did up for grabs. Way up where the grabs are groped the most. But sex is private. That might be one reason we do it—for the most part—in the nude. Clothes falling away signals a situation that I’ll likely avoid putting into words. If clothes don’t dress it up, don’t expect talk to, either.

- It was hiding in plain sight, ([Location 964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0141ZP21G&location=964))
- Harrison didn’t really walk, he swaggered, moving a bit like John Wayne in slow motion—he would take his seemingly bad attitude for a walk. In order to depict this, I moved out of sight around the corner from Harrison and after a moment reappeared, strolling as he strolled, sauntering my way into whatever fresh hell I found myself in. I’d become him, disenchanted Lord Ford, master of all he surveyed, if he got around to it. I studied my environment with bored disenchanted eyes and smirking mouth, behaving as if wherever I’d inadvertently found myself was no doubt some pathetic watering hellhole for a bunch of needy poseurs and poseur wannabes who unfortunately didn’t have the stuff to interest me/him. I hadn’t looked at Harrison yet to see how my portrayal of him was going over—too busy appearing indifferent and impatient with my surroundings. I’d get around to him in good time. Until then, what criminally inept person had decorated this room I was in? Decorated? More like defiled! Wow. I was amazed my eyes weren’t bleeding from the insult some referred to as interior—shouldn’t that be inferior?—decoration.

- I’m afraid that if I stop writing I’ll stop thinking and start feeling. ([Location 1295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0141ZP21G&location=1295))
- Everyone else got to wear their regular outfits from the first movie. I had to wear my outfit that Jabba picked out for me. Jabba the Hutt—the fashionista. Jabba the Hutt—the Coco Chanel of intergalactic style. Trendsetter, fashion maven, leader of women’s looks in his world, on his planet and the next. In wax, I would forever be outfitted by outlaw Jabba. In wax and out, I would forever be stone-faced. ([Location 2319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0141ZP21G&location=2319))
- God never gives us more than we can handle, so if He gives you a lot, take it as a compliment—you catch the overall gist of my drift. ([Location 2349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0141ZP21G&location=2349))
