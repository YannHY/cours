### Highlights

- Like “democracy” and “justice,” “education” is an example of what the philosopher Walter Bryce Gallie called an “essentially contested concept.” It means different things to different people according to their cultural values and how they view related issues like ethnicity, gender, poverty, and social class. ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=70))
- They concluded that if everyone on Earth consumed at the same rate as the average person in India, the Earth could sustain a maximum population of fifteen billion. On that basis, we are halfway there. The trouble is that we don’t all consume at that rate. If everyone consumed at the same rate as the average person in North America, we’re told, the planet could sustain a maximum population of 1.5 billion. We are nearly five times past that already. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=175))
- When we started taking that approach, when kids started seeing that we valued what they valued, they started giving back to us what we valued. ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=244))
- You may see a curious contradiction here. On one hand, politicians are pushing for more academic work in schools; on the other, they say they’re all about economic relevance. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=345))
- Academic qualifications are a form of currency, and like all currencies their value varies with market conditions. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=403))
- He calculates that in the twenty-eight years from 1977 and 2005 more than a million jobs annually disappeared from existing firms in the United States. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=429))
- The two priorities were adaptability to change and creativity in generating new ideas. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=460))
- It’s hard to resist the thought that in the mad rush to standardization, many countries are now dashing to where they think the puck is rather than where it’s really going to be. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=474))
- In the United States, more than a quarter of a million teachers leave the profession every year, and it is estimated that more than 40 percent of new teachers leave the profession within the first five years. ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=502))
- It costs on average eleven thousand dollars a year in the United States to educate a student in high school. It costs more than twenty thousand dollars a year to keep him or her in jail. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=514))
- I say “so-called dropouts” because the term implies that these young people have failed the system. It’s often more accurate to say that the system has failed them. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=518))
- If you were running a business and every year you lost more than a third of your customers, you might start to wonder if the real problem was them or your business. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=521))
- Industrial Purposes ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=660))
- So mass education was built like a pyramid, with a broad base of compulsory elementary education for all, a smaller sector of secondary education, and a narrow apex of higher education. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=673))
- In Germany, for example, the hauptschule is for children who are expected to work in trades, whereas the realschule is for white-collar jobs such as banking, and the gymnasium is for students planning to go to college. In 1944, the British government set up three types of secondary schooling: selective grammar schools, to prepare a minority of students for administrative and professional occupations and college; technical schools, for those likely to take up a trade; and secondary moderns, to prepare the rest for blue-collar jobs. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=676))
- Industrial processes demand compliance with specific rules and standards. This principle is still applied to education. ([Location 687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=687))
- Industrial production is related to market demand. ([Location 693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=693))
- The emphasis on STEM disciplines is another example of market principles being applied to education. ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=696))
- Educating children by age group assumes that the most important thing they have in common is their date of manufacture. ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=714))
- This form of segregation mainly happens in schools. ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=718))
- education is not an industrial process at all; it is an organic one. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=774))
- As in farming, the emphasis in industrial education has been, and increasingly is, on outputs and yield: improving test results, dominating league tables, raising the number of graduates. ([Location 811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=811))
- Education is really improved only when we understand that it too is a living system and that people thrive in certain conditions and not in others. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=816))

- “Being British means driving home in a German car, stopping to buy an Indian curry or an Italian pizza, then spending the evening sitting on Swedish furniture, drinking Belgian beer, and watching American programs on a Japanese TV. And the most British thing of all? Suspicion of anything foreign.” ([Location 869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=869))

- Cultural diversity is one of the glories of human existence. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=879))
- The conventional academic curriculum is focused almost entirely on the world around us and pays little attention to the inner world. We see the results of that every day in boredom, disengagement, stress, bullying, anxiety, depression, and dropping out. These are human issues and they call for human responses. ([Location 925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=925))
- Learning Through Drama, ([Location 1124](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1124))
- Peter Brook. ([Location 1171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1171))
- The only thing you can’t lose is an actor in a space and an audience watching. It may be just one actor and one person watching, but these are the essential and irreducible elements of theater. The actor performs a drama that the audience experiences. ([Location 1177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1177))
- For me, the analogy with education is exact. ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1182))
- the Slow Movement ([Location 1467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1467))
- “Slow Education is about deep learning for meaningful results.” ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1484))

- If your shoes hurt, you don’t polish them or blame your feet; you take the shoes off and wear different ones. If the system doesn’t work, don’t blame the people in it. Work with them to change it so that it does work. ([Location 1531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1531))
- Teach Like Your Hair’s on Fire, ([Location 1564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1564))
- Too often the standards movement casts teachers in the role of service workers, whose job is to “deliver” the standards, as if they were a branch of FedEx. ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1596))

- The job of the gardener is to create the best conditions for that to happen. Good gardeners create those conditions, and poor ones don’t. It’s the same with teaching. ([Location 1616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1616))
- Getting that balance right is what the art of teaching is all about. ([Location 1624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1624))
- Their job is not to teach subjects; it is to teach students. ([Location 1643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1643))
- But expert teachers have a repertory of skills and techniques. Direct instruction is only one of them, and knowing how and when to use the appropriate technique is what great teaching is all about. ([Location 1663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1663))
- “We know why kids drop out. We know why kids don’t learn. It’s poverty, low attendance, negative peer influences. We know why. But one of the things that we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection, relationships.” ([Location 1712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1712))
- The key to raising achievement is to recognize that teaching and learning is a relationship. ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1713))
- “Imagine you have two students sitting next to each other, Mary and John. Mary had the right answer because she understands it. Mary is more likely to convince John than Professor Mazur in the front of the class. Why? Because she has only recently learned it. She still knows what the difficulties are that John has. Whereas Professor Mazur learned it such a long time ago, and to him it is so clear that he no longer understands the difficulties that a beginning learner has.” ([Location 1799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1799))
- Imagination is the root of creativity. It is the ability to bring to mind things that aren’t present to our senses. Creativity is putting your imagination to work. It is applied imagination. Innovation is putting new ideas into practice. ([Location 1840](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1840))
- Store Van Music ([Location 1867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1867))

- The testing and educational support industry is booming. In 2013 it had combined revenues in the United States alone of $16.5 billion.10 To put that in context, the entire U.S. domestic cinema box office gross in 2013 was a little less than $11 billion11 and the National Football League is currently a $9 billion business.12 ([Location 2468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=2468))
- While his school insisted that he give grades on report cards, he abolished all other grades in his classroom and delivered the report card grade only after asking his students to assess their own work and recommend the grade they should receive. The students’ suggestions usually aligned with his, and there were far more cases where students would have recommended a lower grade than a higher one. The result of doing away with grading was that he eased the pressure on his students and allowed them to focus on the content of their assignments and their classwork rather than on the rubric to score them. ([Location 2566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=2566))
- Ultimately, grading gets assessment wrong because assessment is not a spreadsheet—it is a conversation. ([Location 2571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=2571))
- The Learning Record ([Location 2580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=2580))
- Using an online portfolio program called Fresh Grade, teachers in these schools take photos of each student’s work to form a continuous glimpse into each child’s progress that parents and students can share. Teachers work with students to define individual goals and markers of progress, and success is defined through those goals and markers. ([Location 2661](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=2661))

- Use a range of tools, such as starting a parent-based book club or creating assignments that include family interviews, to actively involve parents in schoolwork. ([Location 3189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=3189))
