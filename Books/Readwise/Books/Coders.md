### Highlights

- You use software nearly every instant you’re awake. ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=188))
- Programmers are thus among the most quietly influential people on the planet. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=203))
- The first recorded use of “Hello, World!” was in 1972, when a young computer scientist named Brian Kernighan was writing the manual explaining how to program in the coding language called B. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=247))
- Coding has always had that uncanny hint of thaumaturgy about it. It’s a form of engineering, sure. But unlike in every other type of engineering—mechanical, industrial, civil—the machines we make with software are woven from words. Code is speech; speech a human utters to silicon, which makes the machine come to life and do our will. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=252))
- That’s why the phrase “Hello, World!” is so laden with metaphoric freight. It summons to mind all the religious traditions where a god utters creation into existence: “In the beginning was the Word.” ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=264))
- But “Hello, World!” also has a creepy side. It reminds you of the unexpected side effects that come from bringing something to life that might escape your control—like Dr. Frankenstein’s neglected and vengeful wretch who wound up killing his loved ones, or the uncontrollable, respawning brooms in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=267))
- This is why it tends to attract introverts and puzzle-solving logical thinkers, the types of folks who are happy sitting at home on Saturday night at 11:00 p.m. creating drivers for decommissioned 1997 webcams just because, well, they found an old 1997 webcam in their drawer and want to get it working, and damn it’s an interesting problem, and it’s certainly more predictable than dealing with people. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=285))
- “Dude, I have no idea how you’re going to write this book, because coding is the most boring thing in the world to behold,” as one programmer told me. ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=315))
- Goodbye, world. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=322))
- Their talents are torqued perfectly for capitalism’s central trick, which is, basically, “do something marginally more efficiently than before and then skim off the profit.” ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=361))
- (A study in the ’80s concluded that coders were “less loyal to their employers than to their profession.”) ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=366))
- Some of the most influential software in recent years has been made by groups of mostly young, mostly white, mostly men who didn’t foresee ways their code will affect people who aren’t like them. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=402))
- “Mary Allen, when you grow up you should be a computer programmer!” ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=441))
- In college she’d heard a bit more about computers and how they were supposedly the machines that held the keys to the future. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=452))
- Stanford wouldn’t create a computer science department until 1965.) ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=457))
- At its heart, a computer is really just a massive collection of binary switches, each one representing a single bit, a “1” or a “0”: on or off. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=458))
- To make it easier to manipulate these binary machines, computer scientists in the late ’50s had begun to invent languages like Fortran or COBOL, ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=464))
- As it turns out, Wilkes had an edge: her degree in philosophy. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=466))
- It required her to write in an “assembly language,” which could be pretty abstruse: ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=469))
- Writing a program was like writing a haiku or a sonnet. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=487))
- It’s often a surprise to people today, but at MIT’s Lincoln Labs in the 1960s, when Wilkes worked there, most of the “career programmers” were female. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=491))
- Part of the reason men weren’t full-time programmers is because in the ’60s, the sexy, high-glory part of the job was regarded as building the hardware. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=496))
- It was the brainchild of Wesley Clark, ([Location 509](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=509))
- He was intrigued by the emergence of transistors, ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=510))
- “conversational access” ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=517))
- Wilkes had become one of the first people on the planet to have a personal computer in her home. ([Location 535](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=535))
- (Another pioneering moment: Few people had written a how-to program guide for complete neophytes, because there were few computers aimed at neophytes.) ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=537))
- Using a $120,000 machine to play a video game would likely have seemed, to computer-makers at the time, a madly frivolous thing to do. But the MIT hackers regarded themselves as liberating programming from its mundane history of mere bean counting and scientific problem-solving. ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=574))
- I’d posit that BASIC is, historically, the most consequential computer language in history because it dramatically threw open the floodgates to amateurs. ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=628))
- it stood for a Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=632))
- There aren’t many ways for teenagers to grasp, in such visceral and palpable ways, the fabric of infinity. But typing that two-line program gave them a taste of that power. ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=639))
- “Juvenile delinquency applied to technology will lead you to success.” ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=681))
- One programmer, vibrating with stress from overwork, once hurled a chair across the room after his computer suddenly rebooted and erased his work. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=710))
- Back then, you had to work extra hard to get rid of any bugs, because once you shipped your software out to customers—on floppy disks—you couldn’t easily update or change it. Any bugs in your product were there for a long time, possibly forever. ([Location 714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=714))
- Bugs? Sure, your customers would find lots of bugs. But they’d email you about them, transforming your customers, effectively, into free testers; better yet, since you had thousands or millions of customers, odds were high they’d find every significant bug. ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=718))
- BASIC took programming out from the ivory towers and into teenagers’ basements—but the web planted it firmly into the mainstream. ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=763))
- “Many thousands of people can write code. But only a relative few can get the psychology right.” ([Location 799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=799))
- “See the world as it happens through another’s eyes,” ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=825))
- Part of what made Instagram such a hit was that photos are a universal language: It was the first social network where you could follow—and be followed—by people around the world who didn’t speak or write your language. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=833))
- But social software has impacts that the inventors, who are usually focused on the short-term goal of simply getting their new prototypes to work (and then scale), often fail to predict. ([Location 872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=872))
- “Never before in history have basically fifty mostly men, mostly twenty to thirty-five, mostly white engineer designer types within fifty miles of where we are right now, had control of what a billion people think and do when they wake up in the morning and turn their phone over . . ([Location 881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=881))
- an ingenious hack. ([Location 913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=913))
- Voice trees are an insult to humanity; everyone knows that. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=931))
- (Philosophy students, it seems, make excellent coders: ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=956))
- “The distance between looking like a genius and looking like an idiot in programming? It’s one character wide.” ([Location 977](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=977))
- One early use of the term was in 1876, when Thomas Edison complained about malfunctioning telegraph equipment he was developing. ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=983))
- The phrase entered the lore of programming after 1947, when Harvard engineers discovered that their Mark II was on the fritz because a moth had flown inside the huge machine, ([Location 985](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=985))
- “You are punished swiftly for obvious errors. You are punished more subtly for the less obvious ones.” ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1000))
- He thinks it’s because working with computers all day long is like being forced to share an office with a toxic, abusive colleague. ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1033))
- Well guess what, your spaceship is a complete ball of fire because you forgot a fucking semicolon.” (He’s not speaking metaphorically here: In one of the most famous bugs in history, NASA was forced to blow up its Mariner 1 spacecraft only minutes after launch when it became clear that a bug was causing it to veer off course and possibly crash in a populated area. The bug itself was caused by a single incorrect character.) ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1036))
- I don’t think it’s actually healthy for people to have that mind-set. It’s an occupational hazard! ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1043))
- The entire activity of programming is an exercise in continual failure. ([Location 1098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1098))
- This is the moment you realize that some people just want to watch the world burn. ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1140))
- Indeed, the phrase “user-friendly” is itself hilariously revealing: It implies that most software is “user-hostile,” ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1166))
- Tweepy, ([Location 1240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1240))
- The code still haunts the mind. ([Location 1614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1614))
- “The danger that computers will become like humans,” he noted, “is not as great as the danger that humans will become like computers.” ([Location 1927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1927))
- “The present letter is a very long one, simply because I had no leisure to make it shorter,” as Blaise Pascal once apologized. ([Location 2015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2015))
- Or as Shakespeare put it in an appropriately pithy koan: “Brevity is the soul of wit.” ([Location 2017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2017))
- The odds are high the “problem” they’ll decide needs most urgently to be solved is the re-creation of the conveniences of dorm and home-life—where everyone prepared their meals, cleaned up after them, and ferried them around in vehicles. As my friend Clara Jeffery, the editor in chief of Mother Jones noted in a tweet, “So many Silicon Valley startups are about dudes wanting to replicate mom.” It’s also a symptom of how coding has evolved. ([Location 2108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2108))
- But this code doubled as a snooping device. If you were a Facebook user and logged into the site, any time you visited a page with a Like button on it, the button would tell Facebook where you’d been, even if you never clicked it. In effect, the galloping popularity of Like gave Facebook a neat way to build a mammoth dossier of every user’s surfing habits, across the entire web. ([Location 2159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2159))
- Once You’re Lucky, Twice You’re Good; ([Location 2206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2206))
- This belief in the unicorn programmer isn’t just a piece of pop culture. Indeed, in the real world of software, it’s so well known that the concept has a name: the “10X” coder. As the moniker suggests, it describes a programmer who is provably better, multiple times so, than the average code monkey. ([Location 2231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2231))
- Tech firms, Brooks noted, were treating coding as if it were a form of manual labor, where you can speed something up by simply adding more workers. You need wheat to be picked twice as quickly? Easy: Add twice as many wheat pickers. But coding is an insight-based form of labor, more akin to writing a poem. Merely adding more people doesn’t help, because the solution to any problem is liable to come not from the sweat of many brows but from the lightning-strike aha moment of a single insightful individual. The upshot is that coding was literally the opposite of ditch digging, organizationally. Throwing more coders at an intractable problem can make things worse because it increases the amount of meetings and communication overhead. Brooks formulated this into a pithy koan: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later. ([Location 2272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2272))
- He’s right: The list of small-person or one-person innovators is long. ([Location 2290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2290))
- The job is less “moving fast and creating” than patiently and gently fixing bugs in systems that otherwise more or less work. Andreessen remembers being at IBM as an intern in the early ’90s, where the company had a firm standard: “Ten lines of software code a day. Ten lines written, tested, debugged, documented—no more, and no less. Less than ten lines a day, and you were being lazy. More than ten lines a day, and you were being reckless.” ([Location 2306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2306))
- One cannot bullshit the computer, or bluster through a failed code test. “You can’t argue with a root shell,” ([Location 2367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2367))
- “Code is no respecter of persons. Your code makes you great, not the other way around.” ([Location 2368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2368))
- ‘Code wins arguments.’ ([Location 2372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2372))
- it’s free to use, and anyone can download and inspect its roughly 25 million lines of code. ([Location 2396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2396))
- “benevolent dictator,” ([Location 2407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2407))
- Open source thus contains a curious combination of motivations—an Adam Smithian competition to impress, blended inextricably with a communitarian ethos that might make Karl Marx smile. ([Location 2428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2428))
- we preferred the capitalist Star Wars to the communist Star Trek. ([Location 2499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2499))
- Crowley noticed that inefficiency and wanted to make a tool that would connect not just his close friends but friends of friends, across all networks. They’d all read Harry Potter and knew of the “Marauder’s Map,” a magical document that showed everyone’s location in Hogwarts. ([Location 2679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2679))
- It’s often noted that the first computer programmer ever was a woman: Ada Lovelace. ([Location 2787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2787))
- “We could diagnose troubles almost down to the individual vacuum tube,” as Jennings, one of the women, noted. “Since we knew both the application and the machine, we learned to diagnose troubles as well as, if not better than, the engineer.” ([Location 2815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2815))
- They designed some of the first “compilers.” ([Location 2828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2828))
- A coder could thus write the English-like code, and the compiler would do the hard work of turning it into 1s and 0s for the computer. Grace Hopper was wildly productive in this field, often credited as creating the first compiler, as well as the “FLOW-MATIC” language aimed at nontechnical businesspeople. ([Location 2829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2829))
- they needed to promote coders to management; it didn’t feel right to be putting women in such important positions. ([Location 2873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2873))
- As sociologists have long noted, when a field suddenly becomes increasingly well paid and prominent, men who previously spurned it rush in: We’ll take this over now, ladies, thank you very much. ([Location 2879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2879))
- But that was the peak. From 1984 onward, the percentage slid downhill, slumping even more in the ’90s, such that by the time 2010 rolled around, it had been cut in half. Only 17.6 percent of the students in computer science programs were women. ([Location 2896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2896))
- “What I came to realize,” Gardner tells me, “is that it’s not that women are excluded. It’s that practically everyone is excluded if you’re not a young white man who’s single.” ([Location 3092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3092))
- “One of the most disturbing things,” Roberts tells me, “was that we had a number of students who were majoring in computer science who hated the field. But they knew that was where their millions were coming from.” ([Location 3119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3119))
- So midcareer women in tech were leaving. Sick of years of that crap and not seeing it getting any better—indeed, seeing it getting worse—they voted with their feet. ([Location 3136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3136))
- Software is the laggard, the boys’ club. ([Location 3144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3144))
- When you have a homogenous cohort of people making software and hardware, they tend to produce work that works great for them—but can be useless, or even a disaster for people in other walks of life. ([Location 3152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3152))
- In India, over 40 percent of the students studying computer science are women. ([Location 3241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3241))
- The very word meritocracy has an ironic provenance. When the British politician Michael Young wrote his novel The Rise of the Meritocracy in 1958, he intended it as a biting satire—of governmental attempts to determine an individual’s value based on an IQ test. The term was later adopted as an unironic, literal concept, something that deeply disappointed Young. ([Location 3264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3264))
- But coding itself? That was a group effort, an intellectual barn raising where all strove to make the computer do cool stuff for everyone’s sake. Owning an algorithm you’d written seemed as nuts as “owning” the concept of multiplication itself, or constitutional democracy, or rhyme. ([Location 3490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3490))
- “To a hacker, a closed door is an insult, and a locked door is an outrage,” ([Location 3496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3496))
- (It’s “free” as in “free speech,” not “free” as in “free beer,” as Stallman pointed out.) ([Location 3511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3511))
- For as long as we’ve had computers, coders have dreamed of creating software that behaves like a human. ([Location 3993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3993))
- Yann LeCun ([Location 4062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4062))
- “When people think of AI, they think of sentience,” Ng tells me. “But when I think of AI, I think of automation. That’s the value of AI.” Or as he once put it in a tweet: “Pretty much anything that a normal human can do in <1 sec, we can now automate with AI.” ([Location 4107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4107))
- And you want millions upon millions, ideally. So neural-net coders become absolutely obsessives about gathering data. They always have their octopus tentacles extended, grasping for more. ([Location 4168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4168))
- But if you ask the coder who built it, “How is this thing working?” they’ll shrug. They don’t really know. ([Location 4197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4197))
- It is “an ocean of math,” ([Location 4198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4198))
- get-go ([Location 4203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4203))
- To put it bluntly, the computer learns to be sexist and racist because it learns from what people say,” ([Location 4262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4262))
- The problems don’t stop at race, either. Microsoft Research scientists analyzed Google’s Word2vec and found that it had also learned plenty of sexism, too. The word he was associated with words like boss, philosopher, or architect, while she was associated with socialite, receptionist, and librarian. In one particularly notable pairing, man was associated with computer programmer in the same way that woman was associated with homemaker. ([Location 4264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4264))
- But the odds are, again, that it’s reflecting the bias of preexisting data. ([Location 4284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4284))
- “Big data processes codify the past. They do not invent the future,” ([Location 4294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4294))
- efficiency. ([Location 4310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4310))
- more “objective” ([Location 4310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4310))
- For these coders, tinkering with the AI’s association was an algorithmic version of political correctness. ([Location 4345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4345))
- That’s because AI like this doesn’t just reflect reality; it also shapes it, as O’Neil points out. ([Location 4352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4352))
- In 2018, the EU put into effect a new regulation that establishes an interesting new right for European citizens: the right to an explanation when their lives are impacted by AI. If you got denied a loan by a bank, and part of the reason the bank turned you down was because a deep-learning net predicted you’d be likely to default, you have the right to know why. Why did the system predict that? Right now, no bank could fully explain why. ([Location 4388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4388))
- It was popularized in 1965 by I. J. Good, a statistician who’d worked on code breaking in the Second World War with Alan Turing. In a paper entitled “Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine,” he imagined humans designing the first computer “that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever.” ([Location 4404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4404))
- Me, I’d noticed that Twitter was part of an intriguing shift in people’s ability to pay attention to others. Before Twitter came along, we found out what our friends were doing only irregularly: ([Location 4482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4482))
- “You become like a macroorganism,” he mused. “We’re getting closer to these situations where we can move like a flock of birds or something. ([Location 4490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4490))
- One of my favorite authors is Virginia Woolf, who had a complete knack for this. She would take the smallest detail of life and make it an entire novel. Like Miss Dalloway, one day in one woman’s life, it’s her entire life.” ([Location 4497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4497))
- It’s a machine that does things but which can be replicated globally for little-to-zero additional marginal cost of distribution. It’s as if Chevrolet could design a single Camaro and then instantaneously teleport 200 million copies to the driveways of every household in America.

- I don’t know if there’s ever been historically any other way where you could reach so many people”—or where “so few people define the experience of so many.” ([Location 4540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4540))
- And the ad market has been deeply lucrative for them: In 2017, Twitter’s revenues were $2.4 billion, Facebook’s were $40.65 billion, and Google dwarfed them both with over $100 billion. ([Location 4586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4586))

- “Facebook does not favor hatred,” Vaidhyanathan concludes. “But hatred favors Facebook.” ([Location 4713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4713))
- When you talk to some of those involved in building the social-media tools, they argue that it’s partly a side effect of the engineering mind-set. The coders and designers who built the social networks were skilled in software, logic, systems, efficiency, and breaking big problems into little problems. But they were a gang of mostly young, white, often college-educated kids who understood little about the complexities of the world, about politics, about how people other than themselves lived. And perhaps worse, as with Donald Rumsfeld’s famous koan, didn’t know they didn’t know. It was “fun,” a green-field area, creating tools so people could talk to one another in new fashions. How could more communication be bad? ([Location 4717](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=4717))
- As he argues, he and all the other techies who built social media were enchanted by the narratives of David versus Goliath. They cherished the hackerish ideal of making something that disrupts existing industries—in this case, media. They could accurately predict the good but struggled, with their naive view of the world, to foresee the bad.

- One of the things that makes coding weird, as an industry, is that people can teach themselves how to do it. ([Location 5264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=5264))
- And if they’ve studied very little of the humanities—history, sociology, literature—they often have what Northrop Frye might have called an “uneducated imagination”: ([Location 5341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=5341))

- The upshot, Posner notes, is that when women move into an area of coding, it gets devalued. ([Location 5371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=5371))
- But the world is better served by having people specialize in the things they’re passionate about and letting the people who are passionate about plumbing (or coding) focus on that. ([Location 5436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=5436))
- Indeed, one problem with assuming coding is crucial to navigating the world’s future problems is that this drifts dangerously toward Silicon Valley–style solutionism—assuming that, hey, every problem in the world should be solved with some software!
