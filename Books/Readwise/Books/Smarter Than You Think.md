- You could rank the teams like this: (1) a chess grand master was good; (2) a chess grand master playing with a laptop was better. But even that laptop-equipped grand master could be beaten by (3) relative newbies, if the amateurs were extremely skilled at integrating machine assistance.

- Before computers, it was extremely rare for teenagers to become grand masters. In 1958, Bobby Fischer stunned the world by achieving that status at fifteen. The feat was so unusual it was over three decades before the record was broken, in 1991. But by then computers had emerged, and in the years since, the record has been broken twenty times, as more and more young players became grand masters. In 2002, the Ukrainian Sergey Karjakin became one at the tender age of twelve. So yes, when we’re augmenting ourselves, we can be smarter.

- Memory isn’t passive; it’s active. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=418))
- You’re also regenerating the memory on the fly. You pull up the accurate gist, but you’re missing a lot of details. So you imaginatively fill in the missing details with stuff that seems plausible, whether or not it’s actually what happened. There’s a reason why we call it “re-membering”; we reassemble the past like Frankenstein assembling a body out of parts.

- Bell’s lifelog could well contain the details of a great business idea he had in 1992; but if he’s forgotten he ever had that idea, he’s unlikely to search for it. It remains as remote and unused as if he’d never recorded it at all. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=552))
- Like the hybrid chess-playing centaurs, the solution is to let the computers do what they do best while letting humans do what they do best. ([Location 556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=556))

- Winston thought about it, he realized there were a lot of other e-mails from his life that fit into this odd category—stuff you don’t want to look at but don’t want to lose, either. So he took all these emotionally difficult messages and archived them in Gmail using an evocative label: “Forget.” Out of sight, out of mind, but retrievable. It’s a beautiful metaphor for the odd paradoxes and trade-offs we’ll live with in a world of infinite memory. Our ancestors learned how to remember; we’ll learn how to forget.

- Research suggests that even in the United Kingdom’s peak letter-writing years—the late nineteenth century, before the telephone became common—the average citizen received barely one letter every two weeks, and that’s even if we generously include a lot of distinctly unliterary business missives of the “hey, you owe us money” type.

- You can see this audience effect even in small children. In one of my favorite experiments, a group of Vanderbilt University professors in 2008 published a study in which several dozen four- and five-year-olds were shown patterns of colored bugs and asked to predict which would be next in the sequence. In one group, the children simply solved the puzzles quietly by themselves. In a second group, they were asked to explain into a tape recorder how they were solving each puzzle, a recording they could keep for themselves. And in the third group, the kids had an audience: they had to explain their reasoning to their mothers, who sat near them, listening but not offering any help. Then each group was given patterns that were more complicated and harder to predict. The results? The children who solved the puzzles silently did worst of all. The ones who talked into a tape recorder did better—the mere act of articulating their thinking process aloud helped them think more critically and identify the patterns more clearly. But the ones who were talking to a meaningful audience—Mom—did best of all. When presented with the more complicated puzzles, on average they solved more than the kids who’d talked to themselves and about twice as many as the ones who’d worked silently.

- This is known as the theory of multiples, and it was famously documented in 1922 by the sociologists William Ogburn and Dorothy Thomas. When they surveyed the history of major modern inventions and scientific discoveries, they found that almost all the big ones had been hit upon by different people, usually within a few years of each other and sometimes within a few weeks. ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=871))
- Why would the same ideas occur to different people at the same time? Ogburn and Thomas argued that it was because our ideas are, in a crucial way, partly products of our environment. They’re “inevitable.” When they’re ready to emerge, they do. This is because we, the folks coming up with the ideas, do not work in a sealed-off, Rodin’s Thinker fashion. The things we think about are deeply influenced by the state of the art around us: the conversations taking place among educated folk, the shared information, tools, and technologies at hand.

- Duchesne wrote up his findings in a PhD thesis, but because he was unknown and young—only twenty-three at the time—the French Institut Pasteur wouldn’t acknowledge it. His research vanished, and Duschesne died fifteen years later during his military service, reportedly of tuberculosis. It would take another thirty-two years for Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming to rediscover penicillin, independently and with no idea that Duchesne had already done it. Untold millions of people died in those three decades of diseases that could have been cured. Failed networks kill ideas.

- The birth of Ushahidi is a perfect example of the power of public thinking and multiples. Okolloh could have simply wandered around wishing such a tool existed.

- In 1878, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge helped settle an issue over which horse racing aficionados had long bickered: When a horse is galloping, is there a moment when all four hooves are simultaneously off the ground? Horses gallop so quickly that you can’t clearly perceive this with the unaided eye. So Muybridge invented rapid-fire photography, taking a series of pictures of a galloping horse mere milliseconds from each other, producing a flip-book-like sequence. Sure enough, he proved that the four legs of a galloping horse do leave the ground all at once. Better yet, he invented the first animated video player, the zoopraxiscope, to play the images in succession. When he took it on the road, crowds were fascinated by Muybridge’s ability to slow down, speed up, and freeze-frame the horse. The moving image emerged, in a sense, from our desire to scrutinize the evanescent visual moments of daily life. Our modern digital tools are returning it to those roots.

- To see where things are headed, it would be best to pay attention to these seemingly trivial or even crude amateur experiments, because it’s often in the realm of the amateur where the truly new is possible; amateurs are exempt from the commercial pressures that have locked professional TV, film, and industrial video into its narrow palette of genres and shots.

- Before, when books were scarce, the literate would read and reread the few precious, rare texts to which they had access (often devotional tomes), gradually committing them to memory. But as books became plentiful—to the wealthy literate, anyway—readers shifted from “intensive” reading to our more contemporary mode of “extensive” reading: reading widely, but rarely rereading. (How often have you reread a book?) This shift, in turn, prompted fresh fears that nobody was retaining knowledge. “Whoever tries to retain everything will retain nothing well,” wrote the twelfth-century author of the anthology Libri deflorationum ([Location 1698](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1698))

While we think of knowledge as an individual possession, our command of facts is often extremely collaborative.

- Wegner noticed that spouses often divide up memory tasks. ([Location 1776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1776))
- Together, they know a lot. Separately, less so. ([Location 1779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1779))
- Wegner suspected this division of labor takes place because we have pretty good “metamemory.” We’re aware of our mental strengths and limits, and we’re good at intuiting the abilities of others. ([Location 1779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1779))
- So you begin to subconsciously delegate the task of remembering that stuff to them, treating them like a notepad or encyclopedia. ([Location 1782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1782))
- what we lose in accuracy we make up in speed. ([Location 1784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1784))

- In other words, if we know a digital tool is going to remember a fact, we’re slightly less likely to remember it ourselves. ([Location 1817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1817))
- “We are becoming symbiotic with our computer tools.” ([Location 1830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1830))
- When humans lecture at us, it’s boorish. When machines do it, it’s fine. ([Location 1857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1857))
- We’re seduced into learning more, almost against our will. ([Location 1860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1860))
- it’s hard to know what to trust in a world of self-publishing. To rely on networked digital knowledge, you need to look with skeptical eyes. It’s a skill that should be taught with the same urgency we devote to teaching math and writing. ([Location 1869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1869))

- The members can’t have too much contact with one another. To work best, the members of a collective group ought to be able to think and work independently. ([Location 2338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=2338))
- Traditional brainstorming simply doesn’t work as well as thinking alone, then pooling results. ([Location 2344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=2344))
- This is one of the counterintuitive secrets behind online collaborations. They inherently fit the model of people working together intimately but remotely. ([Location 2349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=2349))
- This is the way David Baker and his team cracked a ten-year-old biological puzzle. ([Location 2368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=2368))
- In effect, Baker had designed a problem that perfectly leveraged collective thinking. It had a specific goal, brought in a diverse range of expertise, encouraged microcontributions, and let people think quietly on their own even while collaborating with others. ([Location 2387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=2387))

- As we approached street level, I could see hundreds of buildings appear, perfectly modeled in 3-D, including gorgeously rendered versions of St. Basil’s Cathedral, with its colorful, bulb-topped towers. Google didn’t design those buildings; fans of 3-D modeling did. Google simply made it easy to contribute, releasing free Building Maker software and an online tool for submitting your building for inclusion in Google Earth.

- “Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation.” ([Location 2455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=2455))
- When she stands up at the chalkboard lecturing on a subject, there’s a predictable pattern that takes hold: one quarter of the kids quickly fall behind, so they tune out. Another quarter already know the material, so they tune out. At best, “you’re teaching to this middle group of students.” Thordarson sighs.

- As various educational analysts have joked, if you brought a bunch of surgeons from a hundred years ago into today’s hospitals, they would have no idea what was going on, because everything about their craft had evolved: antibiotics, laparoscopic devices, MRIs. But time-traveling teachers would have no trouble walking into an elementary school (or even Harvard) and going to work, because schools are nearly identical. Walk to the front of the class, pick up the chalk, and start lecturing. ([Location 2517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=2517))
- It takes the invisible and sometimes mysterious development inside a student’s head and makes it visible. ([Location 2555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=2555))
- Teachers are an inauthentic audience. They aren’t necessarily interested in what their students have to say; they’re just reading as a part of their jobs. A writer is being forced to write for an audience that’s being forced to read. ([Location 2602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=2602))

- If you ask a human friend to get you a glass of milk, he doesn’t need much more instruction. Humans implicitly know what they have to do: Go to the fridge, get a carton of milk, open it up, check that the milk is still fresh, pour it into a glass, keep the glass upright, and put the glass on a flat surface near you so it doesn’t spill. But to program a computer to do the same thing, you’d have to meticulously spell out every teensy step. (If you forget to tell the program to get a glass, it’ll pour the milk on the floor.)

- If science seeks to uncover the invisible rules that govern the world around us, video games are simulated worlds with invisible rule sets just waiting to be uncovered. Teachers should bring games into the classroom, she argues, so they can use them to help explain how science works.

But taken together over time, the snippets coalesce into a surprisingly sophisticated portrait of your friends’ inner lives, like dots forming into a pointillist painting.
