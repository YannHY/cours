### Highlights

- I’ve heard things like a child’s attention span, in minutes, is equal to their age in years. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/724128977/2685818))
- If children are engaged in something, they’ll spend hours on it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/724128977/2685820))
- So the power of the new tool is to use it to do things we couldn’t do before at all. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/724128977/2685827))
- You’ve gotta be careful with the flipped classroom. If what you’re doing is taking the teacher’s one-hour lecture and have it be a one-hour video the kids watch at home, what have they done really? It’s the same model, just on a video. I would say that the real opportunity with a flipped classroom is have the video content be very short. It’s interesting enough as a concept, but my problem is that it’s being used to perpetuate a traditional educational model. One could argue that having the lecture on video is nice, because if you didn’t understand something you could go back and replay it. I’d agree that that is useful. But I think there’s better ways to use technology than that. So I’m not a huge fan. But I think all of these are works in progress that will evolve in the next few years. Hey, at least we’re having good conversations about the topic, and we haven’t had that in a long time. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/724128977/2685835))
- Just don’t ask questions for which Google is the answer. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/724128977/2685838))
