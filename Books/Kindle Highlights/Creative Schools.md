Like “democracy” and “justice,” “education” is an example of what the philosopher Walter Bryce Gallie called an “essentially contested concept.” It means different things to different people according to their cultural values and how they view related issues like ethnicity, gender, poverty, and social class. — location: [70](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=70)

They concluded that if everyone on Earth consumed at the same rate as the average person in India, the Earth could sustain a maximum population of fifteen billion. On that basis, we are halfway there. The trouble is that we don’t all consume at that rate. If everyone consumed at the same rate as the average person in North America, we’re told, the planet could sustain a maximum population of 1.5 billion. We are nearly five times past that already. — location: [175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=175)

When we started taking that approach, when kids started seeing that we valued what they valued, they started giving back to us what we valued. — location: [244](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=244)

You may see a curious contradiction here. On one hand, politicians are pushing for more academic work in schools; on the other, they say they’re all about economic relevance. — location: [345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=345)

The two priorities were adaptability to change and creativity in generating new ideas. — location: [460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=460)

It’s hard to resist the thought that in the mad rush to standardization, many countries are now dashing to where they think the puck is rather than where it’s really going to be. — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=474)

---
In the United States, more than a quarter of a million teachers leave the profession every year, and it is estimated that more than 40 percent of new teachers leave the profession within the first five years. — location: [502](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=502)

It costs on average eleven thousand dollars a year in the United States to educate a student in high school. It costs more than twenty thousand dollars a year to keep him or her in jail. — location: [514](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=514)

I say “so-called dropouts” because the term implies that these young people have failed the system. It’s often more accurate to say that the system has failed them. — location: [518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=518)

So mass education was built like a pyramid, with a broad base of compulsory elementary education for all, a smaller sector of secondary education, and a narrow apex of higher education. — location: [673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=673)

In Germany, for example, the hauptschule is for children who are expected to work in trades, whereas the realschule is for white-collar jobs such as banking, and the gymnasium is for students planning to go to college. In 1944, the British government set up three types of secondary schooling: selective grammar schools, to prepare a minority of students for administrative and professional occupations and college; technical schools, for those likely to take up a trade; and secondary moderns, to prepare the rest for blue-collar jobs. — location: [676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=676)

Industrial processes demand compliance with specific rules and standards. This principle is still applied to education. — location: [687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=687)

This form of segregation mainly happens in schools. — location: [718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=718)

education is not an industrial process at all; it is an organic one. — location: [774](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=774)

As in farming, the emphasis in industrial education has been, and increasingly is, on outputs and yield: improving test results, dominating league tables, raising the number of graduates. — location: [811](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=811)

Education is really improved only when we understand that it too is a living system and that people thrive in certain conditions and not in others. — location: [816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=816)

“Being British means driving home in a German car, stopping to buy an Indian curry or an Italian pizza, then spending the evening sitting on Swedish furniture, drinking Belgian beer, and watching American programs on a Japanese TV. And the most British thing of all? Suspicion of anything foreign.” — location: [869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=869)

The conventional academic curriculum is focused almost entirely on the world around us and pays little attention to the inner world. We see the results of that every day in boredom, disengagement, stress, bullying, anxiety, depression, and dropping out. These are human issues and they call for human responses. — location: [925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=925)

The only thing you can’t lose is an actor in a space and an audience watching. It may be just one actor and one person watching, but these are the essential and irreducible elements of theater. The actor performs a drama that the audience experiences. — location: [1177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1177)

If your shoes hurt, you don’t polish them or blame your feet; you take the shoes off and wear different ones. If the system doesn’t work, don’t blame the people in it. Work with them to change it so that it does work. — location: [1531](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1531)

Too often the standards movement casts teachers in the role of service workers, whose job is to “deliver” the standards, as if they were a branch of FedEx. — location: [1596](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1596)

The job of the gardener is to create the best conditions for that to happen. Good gardeners create those conditions, and poor ones don’t. It’s the same with teaching. — location: [1616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1616)

“We know why kids drop out. We know why kids don’t learn. It’s poverty, low attendance, negative peer influences. We know why. But one of the things that we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection, relationships.” — location: [1712](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1712)

The key to raising achievement is to recognize that teaching and learning is a relationship. — location: [1713](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1713)

“Imagine you have two students sitting next to each other, Mary and John. Mary had the right answer because she understands it. Mary is more likely to convince John than Professor Mazur in the front of the class. Why? Because she has only recently learned it. She still knows what the difficulties are that John has. Whereas Professor Mazur learned it such a long time ago, and to him it is so clear that he no longer understands the difficulties that a beginning learner has.” — location: [1799](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=1799)

Imagination is the root of creativity. It is the ability to bring to mind things that aren’t present to our senses. Creativity is putting your imagination to work. It is applied imagination.

While his school insisted that he give grades on report cards, he abolished all other grades in his classroom and delivered the report card grade only after asking his students to assess their own work and recommend the grade they should receive. The students’ suggestions usually aligned with his, and there were far more cases where students would have recommended a lower grade than a higher one. The result of doing away with grading was that he eased the pressure on his students and allowed them to focus on the content of their assignments and their classwork rather than on the rubric to score them. — location: [2566](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=2566)

Using an online portfolio program called Fresh Grade, teachers in these schools take photos of each student’s work to form a continuous glimpse into each child’s progress that parents and students can share. Teachers work with students to define individual goals and markers of progress, and success is defined through those goals and markers. — location: [2661](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00SNZMCPU&location=2661)
