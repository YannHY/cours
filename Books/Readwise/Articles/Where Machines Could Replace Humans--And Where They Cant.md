### Highlights

- Last year, we showed that currently demonstrated technologies could automate 45 percent of the activities people are paid to perform and that about 60 percent of all occupations could see 30 percent or more of their constituent activities automated, again with technologies available today.

- Technical feasibility ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022109))
- the cost of developing and deploying both the hardware and the software for automation ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022110))
- benefits beyond labor substitution, including higher levels of output, better quality, and fewer errors ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022111))
- Even when machines do take over some human activities in an occupation, this does not necessarily spell the end of the jobs in that line of work. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022138))
- who expect human contact ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022147))
- The hardest activities to automate with currently available technologies are those that involve managing and developing people (9 percent automation potential) or that apply expertise to decision making, planning, or creative work (18 percent) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022198))
- The importance of human interaction is evident in two sectors that, so far, have a relatively low technical potential for automation: healthcare and education. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022199))
- health professionals whose daily activities require expertise and direct contact with patients ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022201))
- For dental hygienists, that proportion drops to 13 percent. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022205))
- Even some of the more complex activities that doctors perform, such as administering anesthesia during simple procedures or reading radiological scans, have the technical potential for automation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022207))
- Yet the essence of teaching is deep expertise and complex interactions with other people. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022212))
- 27 percent of the activities in education—primarily those that happen outside the classroom or on the sidelines—have the potential to be automated with demonstrated technologies. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/754796564/3022224))
