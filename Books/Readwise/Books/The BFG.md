- ‘But because of these jumpsquiffling ears of mine,’ the BFG said, ‘I is not only able to hear the music that dreams is making but I is understanding it also.’ ‘What do you mean understanding it?’ Sophie said. ‘I can read it,’ the BFG said. ‘It talks to me. It is like a langwitch.’ ([Location 1033](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002VISNH6&location=1033))
