## Make a copy

Change the end of an URL by adding `copy`

here is how to share a link with "make a copy" as the default prompt:
 
Go to the sharing dialogue, select "get shareable link", select "anyone with link can view", then select "copy link".
You should have a link that looks like this:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<spreadsheetID>/edit?usp=sharing
 
Then change the last part to /copy instead of /edit?usp=sharing, it should look like this:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<spreadsheetID>/copy
 
Use that link when sharing and the person you are sharing with will get a prompt to "make a copy" when they click it. You can also bookmark that link so that you get the "make a copy" prompt if you are using it for a template.
