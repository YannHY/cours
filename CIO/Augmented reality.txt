# Augmented reality

👀 There is a lot AR Apps in the App Store. Here’s a selection of apps that may find your interest.

😄 A funny example of what you can do with augmented reality is the [Ikea app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/ikea-place/id1279244498). You can pu a sofa on your department room to see if that would be nice. Try it!

The last example is very interesting because you don’t consume content provided by someone else but you can easily thanks to Keynote create your own content. I made a [video about that](https://youtu.be/Mn9lwc2Tf2Y) (in French) on YouTube.
