### Highlights

- Actions take input and generate output, and they're connected in a vertical flow that is run from top to bottom to execute multiple tasks in rapid succession. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/807218042/3612345))
- Upon first launching the app, you'll be presented with an interactive onboarding process aimed at explaining the basics of workflow creation by letting you create a workflow to generate and share a GIF. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/807218042/3612354))

- For Workflow, Weinstein and team created ContentKit, a custom iOS framework that is capable of taking a collection of content items and intelligently coerce them into another format. The ContentKit framework powers the Content Graph, which is a “map” of how input from iOS features and apps is translated throughout workflow actions on the fly. The content transformations that Workflow does and that puts in the user's control are based on a complex technology that allows Workflow to integrate apps and services that are seemingly unrelated, such as Maps and iBooks or Music and Twitter.

If you're unsure about the input type given to a workflow, the app lets you use a debug action to view the Content Graph and how it's processed from the input – it's a neat visualization and useful to understand how actions work.
