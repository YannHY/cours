### Highlights

- This is ideal to build a body of work in Bear and organize it in a single 'Table of Contents' note pinned to the top, for instance. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/802196473/3468718))
- Also, if you enter a HEX color code that Bear recognizes as a color instead of a hashtag, it'll be displayed with a colored dot preview within the note. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/802196473/3468720))
- Bear can be automated and integrated with Workflow using x-callback-url ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/802196473/3468731))
- If you don't want to export your notes as text (.txt), Bear has a variety of options:
  PDF
  HTML
  Markdown
  RTF
  DOCX
  TextBundle
  Bear Note (proprietary)

- Bear brings rich Markdown editing and export ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/802196473/3468861))
- Other editing features that require too many taps in Notes, such as lists or basic text formatting, can be sped up with Markdown in Bear. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/802196473/3468863))
- Bear doesn't have folders. To organize notes, you add tags anywhere in the body of a note as #hashtags, which are parsed and highlighted by Bear. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/802196473/3468864))
- Any note can have an arbitrary number of tags, which grants more flexibility than having to choose a single destination folder. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/802196473/3468865))
- the combination of tags and pins gives Bear an edge over Notes in terms of organization ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/802196473/3468866))
- If you paste an address into a note in Bear, it'll be highlighted with a location icon. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/802196473/3469142))
