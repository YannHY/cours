- Use the [Ask for Input]-[Get Text from Input]-[Set Variable] sequence to prompt a user for a runtime value and store it in a variable.
  Use the [List]-[Choose from List]-[Set Variable] sequence to show a predefined list of values and prompt the user to select one (or more) and store them in a variable.
  Use the [Text]-[Get Contents of Web Pages]-[Get Dictionary from Input]-[Get Value for Key]-[Set Variable] sequence to get a runtime value from a RESTful API that returns a JSON HTTP Response. Write the complete URL (along with any query string) into the [Text] action, before sending the request.
  Use the [Text]-[URL]-[Open X-Callback URL] sequence to define custom URL Scheme and execute it. Write your URL Scheme in the [Text] action, and pass it along to the [URL] action as an Input, before running it with the [Open X-Callback URL] action.
