# Kindle

Do you have a Kindle? If the answer is yes, you may find interesting to know that you can send some books to your device without having to plug it onto your computer.

All you have to do is to follow those few steps.

1. First, you have to download a book. For instance, you can legally and freely download a .mobi file on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) website.
2. Then you have to send it to your kindle. In order to do that, you have to know the Send-to-Kindle e-mail address. To know it, go to the [Manage Your Devices](https://www.amazon.com/myk#manageDevices) page on Amazon. You will find your device and by clicking on the three dots on the left, you will find the adress.
3. You have one more step: add a trusted e-mail account (visit the [Personal Document Settings](https://www.amazon.com/myk#pdocsSettings) page at [Manage Your Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/myk)).
4. To send a document to your Kindle device, simply attach it to an e-mail addressed to your Send-to-Kindle e-mail.

In practice, this is very simple. Say my Send-to-Kindle address is `myadresse@kindle.com`. All I have to do is send my book (or whatever I want: a PDF, a Microsoft document, a picture...) to my Kindle using this address and to send it from a trusted email account (say `myemailaddress@gmail.com`.
