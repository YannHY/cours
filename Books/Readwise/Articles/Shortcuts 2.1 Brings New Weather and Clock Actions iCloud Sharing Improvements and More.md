### Highlights

- if you want to delist a shortcut, you need to reopen its iCloud.com link in the app (Safari should automatically open icloud.com shortcut URLs in the app thanks to Universal Links) and tap the '...' button in the top right corner of the shortcut popup that appears on screen. This button is available only for shortcuts you previously shared from your iCloud account and is displayed even if you no longer have the original shortcut locally installed in the app (because Shortcuts can match your iCloud account with the public shortcut URL). Tapping the button will reveal two options to copy the iCloud link again or to stop sharing the shortcut altogether. If you stop sharing the shortcut, its uploaded data will be wiped from iCloud's servers and the link will stop working. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1122866787/9671772))
