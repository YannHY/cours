### Highlights

- In the main app, AutoSleep uses a clock interface (with an Apple Music-inspired page layout) with colored rings and blocks to represent different bits of data captured by HealthKit. Asleep time is indicated with purple blocks, where lighter purple means deeper sleep; this is calculated by considering physical movement (displayed as an inner green ring) and heart rate (a red ring). In deeper stages of sleep, your heart rate will likely be lower than usual and you'll see a lighter red color block in the associated ring; by contrast, light green indicates you were restless, which tends to be paired with dark purple (light sleep).
