### Highlights

- My face was my identity. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=272))
- Mine was the first female name in three hundred years. ([Location 286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=286))
- Mullahs from TNSM preached that the earthquake was a warning from God. If we did not mend our ways and introduce sharia or Islamic law, more severe punishment would follow. The whole country was in shock for a long time after the earthquake. We were vulnerable. Which made it that much easier for someone with bad intentions to use a nation’s fear for his gain. ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=406))
- They liked his talk of bringing back Islamic law, because everyone was frustrated with the slow, corrupt Pakistani justice system. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=483))
- ‘Coming events cast their shadows before.’ ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=506))
- And I knew in that instant that it wasn’t me, Malala, speaking; my voice was the voice of so many others who wanted to speak but couldn’t. ([Location 780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=780))
- How could one man stop more than fifty thousand girls from going to school? ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=798))
- ‘The Taliban have already blown up hundreds of schools and no one has done anything.’ ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=801))
- I was writing from the privacy of my bedroom, using a secret identity but thanks to the Internet the story of what was happening in Swat was there for the whole world to see. It was as if God had at long last granted my wish for that magic pencil. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=849))
- Hwo ([Location 1474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=1474))
- ‘People experience both joy and suffering in their lives. Now you have had all the suffering at once and the rest of your life will be filled with only joy.’ ([Location 1589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=1589))
- The Taliban shot me to try to silence me. Instead, the whole world was listening to my message now. ([Location 1692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=1692))
- (I was respectful, I believe, but I told him I did not like his drone strikes on Pakistan, that when they kill one bad person innocent people are killed too, and terrorism spreads more. I also told him that if America spent less money on weapons and war and more on education, the world would be a better place. If God has given you a voice, I decided, you must use it, even if it is to disagree with the President of the United States.) ([Location 1939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=1939))
- now those who become warriors are those with higher education, not those who kill lions. ([Location 2043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=2043))
- The British divide the lands they ruled in colonial India into majority Muslim and Hindu areas to create the states of Pakistan and India. Pakistan consists of two regions, East and West Pakistan, separated by Indian territory. ([Location 2290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=2290))
- The princely state of Kashmir, ruled by a Hindu ruler but with a Muslim-majority population, tries to remain independent during partition. ([Location 2294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=2294))
- India and Pakistan clash again over the issue of Kashmir. ([Location 2312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=2312))
- and East Pakistan emerges as an independent country, Bangladesh. ([Location 2331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=2331))
- In response to this, a Muslim guerrilla fighting force, the mujahideen, has risen against the government. ([Location 2339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=2339))
- Although they impose very strict Muslim law on the country, they are seen as a stabilising influence and are therefore supported by the Bhutto government. ([Location 2361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=2361))
- India and Pakistan conduct nuclear tests despite the international trend for nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. ([Location 2368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00JZVKUSC&location=2368))
- Pakistan publicly allies with the United States in the War against Terror amid international pressure. However, because of the porous nature of the shared border with Afghanistan, many people, including militants, enter Pakistan. Osama bin Laden also covertly enters Pakistan by this route.
