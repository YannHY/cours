# Replace your whiteboard

You have an iPad? You have a stylus? Ditch that marker and start writing on your device with:

- [GoodNotes](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/goodnotes-5/id1444383602)
- [Notability](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/notability/id360593530)
- [Concepts](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/concepts/id560586497)

## Why?

Written notes are awesome & colorful
You can add rich content (images, sounds, shapes...)

## Plus 

- You won’t turn your back to your students anymore
- You’ll be able to write while walking through your class (be careful though)
- You’ll never have to erase at the end of the class your lesson
- You can send it to a missing student
