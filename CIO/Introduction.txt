# Introduction

Dear all,

It is my great pleasure to start today this newsletter in which I will share with you all the apps, resources & tips I find useful. It can be teaching, reading, working, getting organised or being more productive, etc.

I wrote a *newsletter*. That is not entirely true since, obviously, you will find emails from me, all of them inviting you to come see me if you want to learn more, but you will find a new Google Classroom as well where you’ll be able to find even more if you want to. But that’s not it. From now on I will use a new Medium account so that we may share what we do at the [Lycée Winston-Churchill of London](https://www.lyceeinternational.london/). What I love with Medium is the possibility a reader has to highlight content with whom he agrees or disagrees. He can add comments and so forth. What’s better to improve the way we work than sharing it? As Michel de Montaigne once wrote it: Your approval or disapproval will both be useful to me.

One more thing. I want to be able to see you in flesh and bones and chat about what we can do to face the challenges of modern education. So let’s have a talk on a regular basis. Let’s have a Genius Bar as we have it for parents but now for teachers as well. Of course all of you are geniuses so I would love to see and then show and share what you do every day at school.
