Before computers, it was extremely rare for teenagers to become grand masters. In 1958, Bobby Fischer stunned the world by achieving that status at fifteen. The feat was so unusual it was over three decades before the record was broken, in 1991. But by then computers had emerged, and in the years since, the record has been broken twenty times, as more and more young players became grand masters. In 2002, the Ukrainian Sergey Karjakin became one at the tender age of twelve. So yes, when we’re augmenting ourselves, we can be smarter. — location: [307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=307)

Memory isn’t passive; it’s active. — location: [418](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=418)

---
You’re also regenerating the memory on the fly. You pull up the accurate gist, but you’re missing a lot of details. So you imaginatively fill in the missing details with stuff that seems plausible, whether or not it’s actually what happened. There’s a reason why we call it “re-membering”; we reassemble the past like Frankenstein assembling a body out of parts. — location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=419)

Bell’s lifelog could well contain the details of a great business idea he had in 1992; but if he’s forgotten he ever had that idea, he’s unlikely to search for it.

Winston thought about it, he realized there were a lot of other e-mails from his life that fit into this odd category—stuff you don’t want to look at but don’t want to lose, either. So he took all these emotionally difficult messages and archived them in Gmail using an evocative label: “Forget.” Out of sight, out of mind, but retrievable. It’s a beautiful metaphor for the odd paradoxes and trade-offs we’ll live with in a world of infinite memory. Our ancestors learned how to remember; we’ll learn how to forget. — location: [672](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=672)

Research suggests that even in the United Kingdom’s peak letter-writing years—the late nineteenth century, before the telephone became common—the average citizen received barely one letter every two weeks, and that’s even if we generously include a lot of distinctly unliterary business missives of the “hey, you owe us money” type. — location: [733](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=733)

You can see this audience effect even in small children. In one of my favorite experiments, a group of Vanderbilt University professors in 2008 published a study in which several dozen four- and five-year-olds were shown patterns of colored bugs and asked to predict which would be next in the sequence. In one group, the children simply solved the puzzles quietly by themselves. In a second group, they were asked to explain into a tape recorder how they were solving each puzzle, a recording they could keep for themselves. And in the third group, the kids had an audience: they had to explain their reasoning to their mothers, who sat near them, listening but not offering any help. Then each group was given patterns that were more complicated and harder to predict. The results? The children who solved the puzzles silently did worst of all. The ones who talked into a tape recorder did better—the mere act of articulating their thinking process aloud helped them think more critically and identify the patterns more clearly. But the ones who were talking to a meaningful audience—Mom—did best of all. When presented with the more complicated puzzles, on average they solved more than the kids who’d talked to themselves and about twice as many as the ones who’d worked silently. — location: [818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=818)

This is known as the theory of multiples, and it was famously documented in 1922 by the sociologists William Ogburn and Dorothy Thomas. When they surveyed the history of major modern inventions and scientific discoveries, they found that almost all the big ones had been hit upon by different people, usually within a few years of each other and sometimes within a few weeks. — location: [871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=871)

---
Why would the same ideas occur to different people at the same time? Ogburn and Thomas argued that it was because our ideas are, in a crucial way, partly products of our environment. They’re “inevitable.” When they’re ready to emerge, they do. This is because we, the folks coming up with the ideas, do not work in a sealed-off, Rodin’s Thinker fashion. The things we think about are deeply influenced by the state of the art around us: the conversations taking place among educated folk, the shared information, tools, and technologies at hand. — location: [877](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=877)

Duchesne wrote up his findings in a PhD thesis, but because he was unknown and young—only twenty-three at the time—the French Institut Pasteur wouldn’t acknowledge it. His research vanished, and Duschesne died fifteen years later during his military service, reportedly of tuberculosis. It would take another thirty-two years for Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming to rediscover penicillin, independently and with no idea that Duchesne had already done it. Untold millions of people died in those three decades of diseases that could have been cured. Failed networks kill ideas. — location: [899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=899)

The birth of Ushahidi is a perfect example of the power of public thinking and multiples. Okolloh could have simply wandered around wishing such a tool existed.

We’re working them out on our own for now and discovering just how powerful they can be. — location: [1205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1205)

In 1878, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge helped settle an issue over which horse racing aficionados had long bickered: When a horse is galloping, is there a moment when all four hooves are simultaneously off the ground? Horses gallop so quickly that you can’t clearly perceive this with the unaided eye. So Muybridge invented rapid-fire photography, taking a series of pictures of a galloping horse mere milliseconds from each other, producing a flip-book-like sequence. Sure enough, he proved that the four legs of a galloping horse do leave the ground all at once. Better yet, he invented the first animated video player, the zoopraxiscope, to play the images in succession. When he took it on the road, crowds were fascinated by Muybridge’s ability to slow down, speed up, and freeze-frame the horse. The moving image emerged, in a sense, from our desire to scrutinize the evanescent visual moments of daily life. Our modern digital tools are returning it to those roots. — location: [1405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1405)

To see where things are headed, it would be best to pay attention to these seemingly trivial or even crude amateur experiments, because it’s often in the realm of the amateur where the truly new is possible; amateurs are exempt from the commercial pressures that have locked professional TV, film, and industrial video into its narrow palette of genres and shots. — location: [1478](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1478)

Before, when books were scarce, the literate would read and reread the few precious, rare texts to which they had access (often devotional tomes), gradually committing them to memory. But as books became plentiful—to the wealthy literate, anyway—readers shifted from “intensive” reading to our more contemporary mode of “extensive” reading: reading widely, but rarely rereading. (How often have you reread a book?) This shift, in turn, prompted fresh fears that nobody was retaining knowledge. “Whoever tries to retain everything will retain nothing well,” wrote the twelfth-century author of the anthology Libri deflorationum — location: [1698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00C5R7AJK&location=1698)
