### Highlights

- Philosophers are very patient people, but engineers are far less patient, and investors are the least patient of all. (Location 135)
- If you don’t know what to do with the power to engineer life, market forces will not wait a thousand years for you to come up with an answer. The invisible hand of the market will force upon you its own blind reply. Unless you are happy to entrust the future of life to the mercy of quarterly revenue reports, you need a clear idea what life is all about. (Location 136)
- Humans think in stories rather than in facts, numbers or equations, (Location 161)
- instead of blindly obeying bigoted priests and hidebound (Location 171)
- In 1938 humans were offered three global stories to choose from, in 1968 just two, in 1998 a single story seemed to prevail; in 2018 we are down to zero. (Location 195)
- To have one story is the most reassuring situation of all. Everything is perfectly clear. To be suddenly left without any story is terrifying. Nothing makes any sense. (Location 197)
- The democratic system is still struggling to understand what hit it, and is hardly equipped to deal with the next shocks, such as the rise of AI and the blockchain revolution. (Location 208)
- because most transactions will not involve a clear-cut (Location 214)
- Humans were always far better at inventing tools than using them wisely. (Location 224)
- In the past, we have gained the power to manipulate the world around us and to reshape the entire planet, but because we didn’t understand the complexity of the global ecology, the changes we made inadvertently disrupted the entire ecological system and now we face an ecological collapse. In the coming century biotech and infotech will give us the power to manipulate the world inside us and reshape ourselves, but because we don’t understand the complexity of our own minds, the changes we will make might upset our mental system to such an extent that it too might break down. (Location 227)
- Thus during the 2016 US presidential race, the main reference to disruptive technology concerned Hillary Clinton’s email debacle,3 and despite all the talk about job losses, neither candidate addressed the potential impact of automation. Donald Trump warned voters that the Mexicans and Chinese will take their jobs, and that they should therefore build a wall on the Mexican border.4 He never warned voters that the algorithms will take their jobs, nor did he suggest building a firewall on the border with California. (Location 233)
- In 2018 the common person feels increasingly irrelevant. (Location 245)
- The liberal story was the story of ordinary people. (Location 247)
- Perhaps in the twenty-first century populist revolts will be staged not against an economic elite that exploits people, but against an economic elite that does not need them any more. (Location 253)
- Thus when the Dutch emerged in 1945 from five years of brutal Nazi occupation, almost the first thing they did was raise an army and send it halfway across the world to reoccupy their former colony of Indonesia. (Location 274)
- No wonder that many national liberation movements throughout the world placed their hopes on communist Moscow and Beijing rather than on the self-proclaimed champions of liberty in the West. (Location 277)
- They still believe in democracy, free markets, human rights and social responsibility, but they think these fine ideas can stop at the border. (Location 294)
- The rising Chinese superpower presents an almost mirror image. It is wary of liberalising its domestic politics, but it has adopted a far more liberal approach to the rest of the world. (Location 296)
- Fears that automation will create massive unemployment go back to the nineteenth century, and so far they have never materialised. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, for every job lost to a machine at least one new job was created, and the average standard of living has increased dramatically.1 Yet there are good reasons to think that this time it is different, and that machine learning will be a real game changer. (Location 407)
- also turned out that the biochemical algorithms of the human brain are far from perfect. They rely on heuristics, shortcuts and outdated circuits adapted to the African savannah rather than to the urban jungle. (Location 425)
- Two particularly important non-human abilities that AI possesses are connectivity and updateability. (Location 445)
- Rather, we should compare the abilities of a collection of human individuals to the abilities of an integrated network. (Location 450)
- Today close to 1.25 million people are killed annually in traffic accidents (twice the number killed by war, crime and terrorism combined). (Location 475)
- replacing all human drivers by computers is expected to reduce deaths and injuries on the road by about 90 per cent. (Location 482)
- After all, what we ultimately ought to protect is humans – not jobs. (Location 485)
- personalised art (Location 542)
- In order to enter the art market and displace many human composers and performers, algorithms won’t have to begin by straightaway surpassing Tchaikovsky. It will be enough if they outperform Britney Spears. (Location 551)
- AI might help create new human jobs in another way. (Location 557)
- The US armed forces need thirty people to operate every unmanned Predator or Reaper drone flying over Syria, while analysing the resulting harvest of information occupies at least eighty people more. (Location 559)
- If so, the job market of 2050 might well be characterised by human–AI cooperation rather than competition. (Location 562)
- The problem with all such new jobs, however, is that they will probably demand high levels of expertise, and will therefore not solve the problems of unemployed unskilled labourers. (Location 567)
- Consequently, despite the appearance of many new human jobs, we might nevertheless witness the rise of a new ‘useless’ class. (Location 577)
- Many people might share the fate not of nineteenth-century wagon drivers – who switched to driving taxis – but of nineteenth-century horses, who were increasingly pushed out of the job market altogether. (Location 579)
- no remaining human job will ever be safe from the threat of future automation, because machine learning and robotics will continue to improve. (Location 581)
- This volatility will also make it more difficult to organise unions or secure labour rights. (Location 584)
- On 7 December 2017 a critical milestone was reached, (Location 595)
- AlphaZero went from utter ignorance to creative mastery in four hours, without the help of any human guide. (Location 605)
- At least in chess, creativity is already the trademark of computers rather than humans! (Location 610)
- The challenge posed to humankind in the twenty-first century by infotech and biotech is arguably much bigger than the challenge posed in the previous era by steam engines, railroads and electricity. (Location 638)
- universal basic income. (Location 692)
- This will cushion the poor against job loss and economic dislocation, while protecting the rich from populist rage. (Location 694)
- Homo sapiens is just not built for satisfaction. Human happiness depends less on objective conditions and more on our own expectations. (Location 763)
- If universal basic support is aimed at improving the objective conditions of the average person in 2050, it has a fair chance of succeeding. But if it is aimed at making people subjectively more satisfied with their lot and preventing social discontent, it is likely to fail. To really achieve its goals, universal basic support will have to be supplemented by some meaningful pursuits, ranging from sports to religion. (Location 765)
- That’s universal basic support avant la lettre. (Location 772)
- As robots and AI push humans out of the job market, the ultra-Orthodox Jews may come to be seen as the model of the future rather than as a fossil from the past. (Location 782)
- If we manage to combine a universal economic safety net with strong communities and meaningful pursuits, losing our jobs to the algorithms might actually turn out to be a blessing. (Location 785)
- the vast majority of the British public – including himself – should never have been asked to vote in the referendum, because they lacked the necessary background in economics and political science. ‘You might as well call a nationwide plebiscite to decide whether Einstein got his algebra right, or let passengers vote on which runway the pilot should land.’ (Location 812)
- Just as divine authority was legitimised by religious mythologies, and human authority was justified by the liberal story, so the coming technological revolution might establish the authority of Big Data algorithms, while undermining the very idea of individual freedom. (Location 834)
- Feelings aren’t based on intuition, inspiration or freedom – they are based on calculation. (Location 838)
- Feelings are thus not the opposite of rationality – they embody evolutionary rationality. (Location 844)
- Kinsey scale. (Location 889)
- But Amazon won’t have to be perfect. It will just need to be better on average than us humans. (Location 927)
- But this is a bit like cataloguing all the drawbacks (Location 932)
- We no longer search for information. Instead, we google. (Location 944)
- As authority shifts from humans to algorithms, we may no longer see the world as the playground of autonomous individuals struggling to make the right choices. Instead, we might perceive the entire universe as a flow of data, see organisms as little more than biochemical algorithms, and believe that humanity’s cosmic vocation is to create an all-encompassing data-processing system – and then merge into it. (Location 980)
- This makes the ethical and philosophical history of the world a rather depressing tale of wonderful ideals and less than ideal behaviour. (Location 1011)
- We have inherited our anger, our fear and our lust from millions of ancestors, all of whom passed the most rigorous quality control tests of natural selection. (Location 1014)
- Computer algorithms, however, have not been shaped by natural selection, and they have neither emotions nor gut instincts. Hence in moments of crisis they could follow ethical guidelines much better than humans – provided we find a way to code ethics in precise numbers and statistics. (Location 1024)
- In effect, every car will be driven by Michael Schumacher and Immanuel Kant rolled into one. (Location 1028)
- However, in order to take over from human drivers, the algorithms won’t have to be perfect. They will just have to be better than the humans. (Location 1035)
- the Schumacher–Kant team? (Location 1038)
- we can rely on machines to implement and maintain this standard better than humans. (Location 1042)
- computers don’t have a subconscious. (Location 1046)
- there is always a danger that the engineers will somehow program their own subconscious biases into the software. (Location 1047)
- Yet once we discover such mistakes, it would probably be far easier to debug the software than to rid humans of their racist and misogynist biases. (Location 1049)
- However, there might be some new openings for philosophers, because their skills – hitherto devoid of much market value – will suddenly be in very high demand. So if you want to study something that will guarantee a good job in the future, maybe philosophy is not such a bad gamble. (Location 1051)
- Well, maybe Tesla will just leave it to the market. Tesla will produce two models of the self-driving car: the Tesla Altruist and the Tesla Egoist. (Location 1057)
- After all, the customer is always right. (Location 1060)
- Yet the real problem with robots is exactly the opposite. We should fear them because they will probably always obey their masters and never rebel. (Location 1075)
- The real problem with robots is not their own artificial intelligence, but rather the natural stupidity and cruelty of their human masters. (Location 1089)
- When you apply to your bank for a loan, it is likely that your application is processed by an algorithm rather than by a human. (Location 1163)
- Instead of just collective discrimination, in the twenty-first century we might face a growing problem of individual discrimination. (Location 1174)
- an illusion of choice, (Location 1182)
- Science fiction tends to confuse intelligence with consciousness, (Location 1188)
- If we are not careful, we will end up with downgraded humans misusing upgraded computers to wreak havoc on themselves and on the world. (Location 1231)
- Hierarchy was not just the norm, but also the ideal. How can there be order without a clear hierarchy between aristocrats and commoners, between men and women, or between parents and children? Priests, philosophers and poets all over the world patiently explained that just as in the human body not all members are equal – the feet must obey the head (Location 1249)
- Already today, the richest 1 per cent owns half the world’s wealth. Even more alarmingly, the richest hundred people together own more than the poorest 4 billion. (Location 1264)
- From this perspective, current populist resentment of ‘the elites’ is well founded. (Location 1289)
- At present, people are happy to give away their most valuable asset – their personal data – in exchange for free email services and funny cat videos. It is a bit like African and Native American tribes who unwittingly sold entire countries to European imperialists in exchange for colourful beads and cheap trinkets. (Location 1329)
- Mandating governments to nationalise the data will probably curb the power of big corporations, but it may also result in creepy digital dictatorships. (Location 1342)
- As much as we should fear the power of big corporations, history suggests that we are not necessarily better off in the hands of over-mighty governments. (Location 1346)
- Private ownership of one’s own data may sound more attractive (Location 1349)
- We have had thousands of years of experience in regulating the ownership of land. (Location 1350)
- Over the past two centuries we have become extremely sophisticated in regulating the ownership of industry (Location 1351)
- words are cheaper than actions, (Location 1401)
- Tristan Harris, (Location 1448)
- It and the other online giants tend to view humans as audiovisual animals – a pair of eyes and a pair of ears connected to ten fingers, a screen and a credit card. (Location 1477)
- renounce its multicultural fallacy in favour of an unabashed (Location 1499)
- Think of twentieth-century Germans, for example. In less than a hundred years the Germans organised themselves into six very different systems: the Hohenzollern Empire, the Weimar Republic, the Third Reich, the German Democratic Republic (aka communist East Germany), the Federal Republic of Germany (aka West Germany), and finally democratic reunited Germany. (Location 1519)
- similar scandal erupted when HaMevaser paper expunged (Location 1551)
- days. Brexit may well initiate the simultaneous unravelling (Location 1584)
- The Islamic State has recently stood out in its complete rejection of this package, and in its attempt to establish an entirely different kind of political entity – a universal caliphate. But precisely for this reason it has failed. (Location 1618)
- Even countries such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Congo have adopted Western musical conventions for their anthems. Most of them sound like something composed by Beethoven on a rather mediocre day. (Location 1632)
- National flags display the same dreary conformity. With a single exception, all flags are rectangular pieces of cloth marked by an extremely limited repertoire of colours, stripes and geometrical shapes. (Location 1648)
- For all the national pride people feel when their delegation wins a gold medal and their flag is raised, there is far greater reason to feel pride that humankind is capable of organising such an event. (Location 1683)
- People still have different religions and national identities. But when it comes to the practical stuff – how to build a state, an economy, a hospital, or a bomb – almost all of us belong to the same civilisation. (Location 1723)
- Whatever changes await us in the future, they are likely to involve a fraternal struggle within a single civilisation rather than a clash between alien civilisations. (Location 1739)
- Such mass loyalties have appeared only in the last few thousand years (Location 1757)
- regulate the flow of the river, build grain reserves for lean (Location 1765)
- It is a dangerous mistake to imagine that without nationalism we would all be living in a liberal paradise. More likely, we would be living in tribal chaos. (Location 1777)
- The list of countries lacking robust national bonds includes Afghanistan, Somalia, Congo and most other failed states.1 (Location 1779)
- We must either love each other, or we must die.’2 We tend to associate the ‘make love, not war’ slogan with the late 1960s counterculture, but in fact, already in 1964 it was accepted wisdom even among hard-nosed politicians such as Johnson. (Location 1799)
- Narendra Modi and their colleagues save the world by fanning (Location 1809)
- For thousands of years Homo sapiens behaved as an ecological serial killer; now it is morphing into an ecological mass murderer. (Location 1846)
- We need to enter rehab today. Not next year or next month, but today. ‘Hello, I am Homo sapiens, and I am a fossil-fuel addict.’ (Location 1869)
- it takes about 15,000 litres of fresh water to produce one kilogram of beef, compared to 287 litres needed to produce a kilogram of potatoes. (Location 1881)
- If humankind fails to devise and administer globally accepted ethical guidelines, it will be open season for Dr Frankenstein. (Location 1933)
- On the other hand, we might witness the complete decoupling of intelligence from consciousness, and the development of AI might result in a world dominated by super-intelligent but completely non-conscious entities. (Location 1942)
- the only real solution is to globalise politics. (Location 1999)
- Billions of humans still profess greater faith in the Quran and the Bible than in the theory of evolution; (Location 2012)
- Prozac supplants exorcism. (Location 2035)
- The victory of science has been so complete that our very idea of religion has changed. We no longer associate religion with farming and medicine. (Location 2036)
- the mark of science is the willingness to admit failure and try a different tack. (Location 2045)
- Hence the Quran is degraded from a source of true knowledge to a source of mere authority. (Location 2070)
- it has become common to interpret even ostensibly religious conflicts in economic terms, whereas nobody thinks of doing the reverse. (Location 2084)
- ‘the narcissism of small differences’. (Location 2130)
- We know these missiles as the kamikaze. (Location 2153)
- Though many traditional religions espouse universal values and claim cosmic validity, at present they are used mainly as the handmaid of modern nationalism (Location 2175)
- Traditional racism is waning, but the world is now full of ‘culturists’. (Location 2362)
- Yet the worst problem with culturist claims is that despite their statistical nature they are all too often used to prejudge individuals. (Location 2415)
- Terrorists are masters of mind control. They kill very few people, but nevertheless manage to terrify billions and shake huge political structures such as the European Union or the United States. (Location 2446)
- Since 11 September 2001, every year terrorists have killed about fifty people in the European Union, about ten people in the USA, about seven people in China, and up to 25,000 people globally (mostly in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria).1 In contrast, each year traffic accidents kill about 80,000 Europeans, 40,000 Americans, 270,000 Chinese, and 1.25 million people altogether.2 Diabetes and high sugar levels kill up to 3.5 million people annually, while air pollution kills about 7 million people.3 So why do we fear terrorism more than sugar, and why do governments lose elections because of sporadic terror attacks but not because of chronic air pollution? (Location 2447)
- Terrorists stage a terrifying spectacle of violence that captures our imagination and turns it against us. (Location 2496)
- Terrorists don’t think like army generals. Instead, they think like theatre producers. (Location 2500)
- The state has created a huge space empty of political violence, which now acts as a sounding board, amplifying the impact of any armed attack, however small. The less political violence in a particular state, the greater the public shock at an act of terrorism. (Location 2553)
- Russia has a population of 150 million people and a GDP of $4 trillion. In both population and production it is dwarfed by the USA (325 million people and $19 trillion) and the European Union (500 million people and $21 trillion).6 Together, the USA and EU have five times more people than Russia, and ten times more dollars. (Location 2703)
- One of the astounding things about the Second World War is that following the war the defeated powers prospered as never before. Twenty years after the complete annihilation of their armies and the utter collapse of their empires, Germans, Italians and Japanese were enjoying unprecedented levels of affluence. (Location 2756)
- One potential remedy for human stupidity is a dose of humility. (Location 2773)
- The Old Testament, the Talmud and many (though not all) rabbis maintained that the life of a Jew is more valuable than the life of a Gentile, which is why, for example, Jews are allowed to desecrate the Sabbath in order to save a Jew from death, but are forbidden to do so merely in order to save a Gentile (Babylonian Talmud, Yoma 84:2). (Location 2909)
- It therefore makes absolutely no sense to credit Judaism and its Christian and Muslim offspring with the creation of human morality. (Location 2930)
- From an ethical perspective, monotheism was arguably one of the worst ideas in human history. (Location 2938)
- Polytheists found it perfectly acceptable that different people will worship different gods and perform diverse rites and rituals. They rarely if ever fought, persecuted, or killed people just because of their religious beliefs. Monotheists, in contrast, believed that their God was the only god, and that He demanded universal obedience. Consequently, as Christianity and Islam spread around the world, so did the incidence of crusades, jihads, inquisitions and religious discrimination. (Location 2942)
- about 20 per cent of all Nobel Prize laureates in science have been Jews, though Jews constitute less than 0.2 per cent of the world’s population. (Location 2970)
- The central value of education in Jewish culture was one of the main reasons for the extraordinary success of Jewish scientists. Other factors included the desire of a persecuted minority to prove its worth, and the barriers that prevented talented Jews from advancement in more anti-Semitic institutions such as the army and the state administration. (Location 2984)
- Anti-Semites usually think that Jews are very important. (Location 3009)
- The creator of space and time supposedly composed it, but He bothered to enlighten us mainly about some arcane temple rituals and food taboos. (Location 3043)
- To the best of our scientific knowledge, all these sacred texts were written by imaginative Homo sapiens. They are just stories invented by our ancestors in order to legitimise social norms and political structures. (Location 3046)
- Perhaps the deeper meaning of this commandment is that we should never use the name of God to justify our political interests, our economic ambitions or our personal hatreds. (Location 3052)
- The idea that we need a supernatural being to make us act morally assumes that there is something unnatural about morality. (Location 3074)
- You would not like to live in a society where strangers are routinely robbed and murdered. Not only would you be in constant danger, but you would lack the benefit of things like commerce, which depends on trust between strangers. Merchants don’t usually visit dens of thieves. (Location 3091)
- Questions you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot question. (Location 3187)
- Humans rarely think for themselves. Rather, we think in groups. (Location 3299)
- We rely on the expertise of others for almost all our needs. (Location 3306)
- This is what Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach have termed ‘the knowledge illusion’. (Location 3309)
- From an evolutionary perspective, trusting in the knowledge of others has worked extremely well for Homo sapiens. (Location 3313)
- One would have thought that conservatives would care far more about the conservation of the old ecological order, and about protecting their ancestral lands, forests and rivers. In contrast, progressives could be expected to be far more open to radical changes to the countryside, especially if the aim is to speed up progress and increase the human standard of living. (Location 3329)
- that in a previous book I assumed aboriginal (Location 3440)
- In 1931 the Japanese army staged mock attacks on itself to justify its invasion of China, and then created the fake country of Manchukuo to legitimise its conquests. China itself has long denied that Tibet ever existed as an independent country. British settlement in Australia was justified by the legal doctrine of terra nullius (‘nobody’s land’), which effectively erased 50,000 years of Aboriginal history. (Location 3519)
- In the early twentieth century a favourite Zionist slogan spoke of the return of ‘a people without a land [the Jews] to a land without a people [Palestine]’. (Location 3522)
- Homo sapiens is a post-truth species, whose power depends on creating and believing fictions. (Location 3529)
- We are the only mammals that can cooperate with numerous strangers because only we can invent fictional stories, spread them around, and convince millions of others to believe in them. (Location 3531)
- As long as everybody believes in the same fictions, we all obey the same laws, and can thereby cooperate effectively. (Location 3532)
- For millennia, much of what passed for ‘news’ and ‘facts’ in human social networks were stories about miracles, angels, demons and witches, with bold reporters giving live coverage straight from the deepest pits of the underworld. (Location 3536)
- When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month – that’s fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years – that’s a religion, and we are admonished not to call it ‘fake news’ in order not to hurt the feelings of the faithful (or incur their wrath). (Location 3541)
- Adam and Eve never existed, but Chartres Cathedral is still beautiful. (Location 3545)
- After Japan’s defeat Hirohito publicly proclaimed that this was not true, and that he wasn’t a god after all. (Location 3558)
- Eventually, in 1290 the entire Jewish population of England was expelled. (Location 3567)
- Well, some fake news lasts only 700 years. (Location 3582)
- ‘A lie told once remains a lie, but a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth.’ (Location 3586)
- Besides religions and ideologies, commercial firms too rely on fiction and fake news. (Location 3609)
- The truth is that truth was never high on the agenda of Homo sapiens. (Location 3615)
- You cannot play games or read novels unless you suspend disbelief at least for a little while. (Location 3654)
- if you want reliable information – pay good money for it. (Location 3690)
- Humans control the world because they can cooperate better than any other animal, and they can cooperate so well because they believe in fictions. Poets, painters and playwrights are therefore at least as important as soldiers and engineers. (Location 3711)
- In thinking about the future of AI, Karl Marx is still a better guide than Steven Spielberg. (Location 3724)
- Whenever you see a movie about an AI in which the AI is female and the scientist is male, it’s probably a movie about feminism rather than cybernetics. (Location 3728)
- It’s not that somewhere in your mind there is an iron chest with a big red warning sign ‘Open only in Fiji!’ and when you finally travel to the South Pacific you get to open the chest, and out come all kinds of special emotions and feelings that you can have only in Fiji. And if you never visit Fiji in your life, then you missed these special feelings for ever. (Location 3758)
- At present, too many schools focus on cramming information. (Location 3898)
- There was no radio, television, daily newspapers or public libraries.1 Even if you were literate and had access to a private library, there was not much to read other than novels and religious tracts. The Spanish Empire heavily censored all texts printed locally, and allowed only a dribble of vetted publications to be imported from outside. (Location 3900)
- In contrast, in the twenty-first century we are flooded by enormous amounts of information, and even the censors don’t try to block it. (Location 3906)
- In such a world, the last thing a teacher needs to give her pupils is more information. (Location 3913)
- Besides information, most schools also focus too much on providing pupils with a set of predetermined skills (Location 3923)
- Many pedagogical experts argue that schools should switch to teaching ‘the four Cs’ – critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity. (Location 3929)
- Most important of all will be the ability to deal with change, to learn new things, and to preserve your mental balance in unfamiliar situations. (Location 3931)
- you will above all need to reinvent yourself again and again. (Location 3933)
- When you are fifteen, your entire life is change. Your body is growing, your mind is developing, your relationships are deepening. Everything is in flux, and everything is new. You are busy inventing yourself. Most teenagers find it frightening, but at the same time, it is also exciting. New vistas are opening before you, and you have an entire world to conquer. (Location 3963)
- feel at home with the unknown. (Location 3983)
- The Industrial Revolution has bequeathed us the production-line theory of education. (Location 3987)
- It is easy to laugh at this model, and almost everybody agrees that no matter its past achievements, it is now bankrupt. But so far we haven’t created a viable alternative. (Location 3991)
- don’t rely on the adults too much. (Location 3994)
- Due to the growing pace of change you can never be certain whether what the adults are telling you is timeless wisdom or outdated bias. (Location 3996)
- In almost all cases, when people ask about the meaning of life, they expect to be told a story. Homo sapiens is a storytelling animal, that thinks in stories rather than in numbers or graphs, and believes that the universe itself works like a story, replete with heroes and villains, conflicts and resolutions, climaxes and happy endings. When we look for the meaning of life, we want a story that will explain what reality is all about and what is my particular role in the cosmic drama. This role defines who I am, and gives meaning to all my experiences and choices. (Location 4033)
- The Circle of Life presents the cosmic drama as a circular story. (Location 4064)
- Zionism holds sacred the adventures of about 0.2 per cent of humankind and 0.005 per cent of the earth’s surface during a tiny fraction of the span of time. (Location 4104)
- (if I really lived millions of lives, I must have been a dinosaur and an amoeba at some point, for humans have existed for only the last 2.5 million years)? (Location 4184)
- A wise old man was asked what he learned about the meaning of life. ‘Well,’ he answered, ‘I have learned that I am here on earth in order to help other people. What I still haven’t figured out is why the other people are here.’ (Location 4209)
- People are taught to believe in the story from early childhood. They hear it from their parents, their teachers, their neighbours and the general culture long before they develop the intellectual and emotional independence necessary to question and verify such stories. (Location 4230)
- ‘Hocus pocus, X is Y!’ (Location 4253)
- In the minds of the illiterate peasants, who did not speak Latin, ‘Hoc est corpus!’ got garbled into ‘Hocus pocus!’ and thus was born the powerful spell that can transform a frog into a prince, and a pumpkin into a carriage. (Location 4258)
- Why does the Indian government invest scarce resources in weaving enormous flags, instead of building sewage systems in Delhi’s slums? Because the flag makes India real in a way that sewage systems do not. (Location 4309)
- The Sabbath starts at sunset on Friday, and lasts until sunset on Saturday, and in between Orthodox Jews refrain from almost any kind of work, including even tearing off toilet paper from a roll in the lavatory. (There has been some discussion of this among the most learned rabbis, and they concluded that tearing toilet paper will break the Sabbath taboo, and consequently devout Jews who want to wipe their bottoms on the Sabbath have to prepare a stash of pre-torn toilet paper in advance.

- Unfortunately, when people talk of the ills of fascism they often do a poor job, because they tend to depict fascism as a hideous monster while failing to explain what is so seductive about it. This is why today people sometimes adopt fascist ideas without realising it. People think, ‘I was taught that fascism is ugly, and when I look in the mirror I see something very beautiful, so I cannot be a fascist.’ It is a bit like the mistake Hollywood movies make when they depict the bad guys – Voldemort, Lord Sauron, Darth Vader – as ugly and mean. They are usually cruel and nasty even towards their most loyal supporters. What I never understand when watching such movies is why anyone would be tempted to follow a disgusting creep like Voldemort. The problem with evil is that in real life, it is not necessarily ugly. It can look very beautiful. Christianity knew this better than Hollywood, which is why traditional Christian art tended to depict Satan as a gorgeous hunk. (Location 4420)
- The word ‘fascism’ comes from the Latin ‘fascis’, meaning ‘a bundle of rods’. That sounds like a rather unglamorous symbol for one of the most ferocious and deadly ideologies in world history. But it has a deep and sinister meaning. A single rod is very weak, and you can easily snap it in two. However, once you bundle many rods together into a fascis, it becomes almost impossible to break them. This implies that the individual is a thing of no consequence, but as long as the collective sticks together, it is very powerful.16 Fascists therefore believe in privileging the interests of the collective over those of any individual, and demand that no single rod ever dare break the unity of the bundle.

- Something here doesn’t make sense. If indeed the martyrs killed by the French air force are now in heaven, why should anyone seek revenge for it? Revenge for what, exactly? For sending people to heaven? If you just heard that your beloved brother won a million dollars in the lottery, would you start blowing up lottery stalls in revenge? So why go rampaging in Paris just because the French air force gave a few of your brothers a one-way ticket to paradise? It would be even worse if you indeed managed to deter the French from carrying out further bombings in Syria. For in that case, fewer Muslims would get to heaven. (Location 4457)
- This uncertainty rattled most religions, which therefore considered faith to be a cardinal virtue and doubt to be among the worst sins possible. As if there was something intrinsically good about believing things without evidence. (Location 4477)
- In this, Hamlet is the paradigmatic modern hero. Modernity didn’t reject the plethora of stories it inherited from the past. Instead, it opened a supermarket for them. The modern human is free to sample them all, choosing and combining whatever fits his or her taste. (Location 4482)

- At first, we realise that we do not control the world outside us. I don’t decide when it rains. Then we realise that we do not control what’s happening inside our own body. I don’t control my blood pressure. Next, we understand that we don’t even govern our brain. I don’t tell the neurons when to fire. Ultimately we should realise that we do not control our desires, or even our reactions to these desires. (Location 4534)

- When people ask the big questions of life, they usually have absolutely no interest in knowing when their breath is coming into their nostrils and when is it going out. Rather, they want to know things like what happens after you die. Yet the real enigma of life is not what happens after you die, but what happens before you die. If you want to understand death, you need to understand life. (Location 4697)
- The first thing I learned by observing my breath was that notwithstanding all the books I had read and all the classes I had attended at university, I knew almost nothing about my mind, and I had very little control over it. (Location 4710)
- For years I lived under the impression that I was the master of my life, and the CEO of my own personal brand. But a few hours of meditation were enough to show me that I hardly had any control of myself. I was not the CEO – I was barely the gatekeeper. (Location 4712)
