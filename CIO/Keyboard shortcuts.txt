# Keyboard shortcuts

⌨️ Are you a keyboard heavy user? Then you must be aware that by pressing [certain key combinations](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236), you can do things that normally need a mouse, trackpad or your finger.

😩 As a matter of fact it is sometimes a waste of time and it can be boring to select text, raise your hand, find the right menu, press whatever you want, return to your keyboard and so on. What if you could keep your both hands on your keyboard and start doing actions without having to lift your aching arm and fingers?

After all, you may know some of these very famous combination:

- Copy : `⌘ + C`
- Paste : `⌘ + V`
- Undo : `⌘ + Z`
- Select all : `⌘ + A`

And maybe so much more.

🦄 This one is truly magical. Find any word or any sentence on a document of a 15 thousands word in a sec: `⌘ + F`

👍 By using keyboard shortcuts not only you will work faster, you will work smarter and better.

As a reminder, these symbols stand for:

- Command (or Cmd) ⌘
- Shift ⇧
- Option (or Alt) ⌥
- Control (or Ctrl) ⌃
- Caps Lock ⇪

But there is so much more. Let’s find out.
