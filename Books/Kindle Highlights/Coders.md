You use software nearly every instant you’re awake. — location: [188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=188)

Programmers are thus among the most quietly influential people on the planet. — location: [203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=203)

The first recorded use of “Hello, World!” was in 1972, when a young computer scientist named Brian Kernighan was writing the manual explaining how to program in the coding language called B. — location: [247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=247)

Coding has always had that uncanny hint of thaumaturgy about it. It’s a form of engineering, sure. But unlike in every other type of engineering—mechanical, industrial, civil—the machines we make with software are woven from words. Code is speech; speech a human utters to silicon, which makes the machine come to life and do our will. — location: [252](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=252)

---
That’s why the phrase “Hello, World!” is so laden with metaphoric freight. It summons to mind all the religious traditions where a god utters creation into existence: “In the beginning was the Word.” — location: [264](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=264)

---
But “Hello, World!” also has a creepy side. It reminds you of the unexpected side effects that come from bringing something to life that might escape your control—like Dr. Frankenstein’s neglected and vengeful wretch who wound up killing his loved ones, or the uncontrollable, respawning brooms in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice. — location: [267](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=267)

---
This is why it tends to attract introverts and puzzle-solving logical thinkers, the types of folks who are happy sitting at home on Saturday night at 11:00 p.m. creating drivers for decommissioned 1997 webcams just because, well, they found an old 1997 webcam in their drawer and want to get it working, and damn it’s an interesting problem, and it’s certainly more predictable than dealing with people. — location: [285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=285)

“Dude, I have no idea how you’re going to write this book, because coding is the most boring thing in the world to behold,” as one programmer told me. — location: [315](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=315)

Their talents are torqued perfectly for capitalism’s central trick, which is, basically, “do something marginally more efficiently than before and then skim off the profit.” — location: [361](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=361)

Some of the most influential software in recent years has been made by groups of mostly young, mostly white, mostly men who didn’t foresee ways their code will affect people who aren’t like them. — location: [402](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=402)

At its heart, a computer is really just a massive collection of binary switches, each one representing a single bit, a “1” or a “0”: on or off. — location: [458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=458)

---
To make it easier to manipulate these binary machines, computer scientists in the late ’50s had begun to invent languages like Fortran or COBOL, — location: [464](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=464)

As it turns out, Wilkes had an edge: her degree in philosophy. — location: [466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=466)

It required her to write in an “assembly language,” which could be pretty abstruse: — location: [469](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=469)

Writing a program was like writing a haiku or a sonnet. — location: [487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=487)

---
It’s often a surprise to people today, but at MIT’s Lincoln Labs in the 1960s, when Wilkes worked there, most of the “career programmers” were female. — location: [491](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=491)

---
Part of the reason men weren’t full-time programmers is because in the ’60s, the sexy, high-glory part of the job was regarded as building the hardware. — location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=496)

(Another pioneering moment: Few people had written a how-to program guide for complete neophytes, because there were few computers aimed at neophytes.) — location: [537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=537)

---
Using a $120,000 machine to play a video game would likely have seemed, to computer-makers at the time, a madly frivolous thing to do. But the MIT hackers regarded themselves as liberating programming from its mundane history of mere bean counting and scientific problem-solving. — location: [574](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=574)

I’d posit that BASIC is, historically, the most consequential computer language in history because it dramatically threw open the floodgates to amateurs. — location: [628](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=628)

There aren’t many ways for teenagers to grasp, in such visceral and palpable ways, the fabric of infinity. But typing that two-line program gave them a taste of that power. — location: [639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=639)

One programmer, vibrating with stress from overwork, once hurled a chair across the room after his computer suddenly rebooted and erased his work. — location: [710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=710)

---
Back then, you had to work extra hard to get rid of any bugs, because once you shipped your software out to customers—on floppy disks—you couldn’t easily update or change it. Any bugs in your product were there for a long time, possibly forever. — location: [714](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=714)

---
Bugs? Sure, your customers would find lots of bugs. But they’d email you about them, transforming your customers, effectively, into free testers; better yet, since you had thousands or millions of customers, odds were high they’d find every significant bug. — location: [718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=718)

BASIC took programming out from the ivory towers and into teenagers’ basements—but the web planted it firmly into the mainstream. — location: [763](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=763)

Part of what made Instagram such a hit was that photos are a universal language: It was the first social network where you could follow—and be followed—by people around the world who didn’t speak or write your language. — location: [833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=833)

But social software has impacts that the inventors, who are usually focused on the short-term goal of simply getting their new prototypes to work (and then scale), often fail to predict. — location: [872](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=872)

Well guess what, your spaceship is a complete ball of fire because you forgot a fucking semicolon.” (He’s not speaking metaphorically here: In one of the most famous bugs in history, NASA was forced to blow up its Mariner 1 spacecraft only minutes after launch when it became clear that a bug was causing it to veer off course and possibly crash in a populated area. The bug itself was caused by a single incorrect character.) — location: [1036](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1036)

Indeed, the phrase “user-friendly” is itself hilariously revealing: It implies that most software is “user-hostile,” — location: [1166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=1166)

The odds are high the “problem” they’ll decide needs most urgently to be solved is the re-creation of the conveniences of dorm and home-life—where everyone prepared their meals, cleaned up after them, and ferried them around in vehicles. As my friend Clara Jeffery, the editor in chief of Mother Jones noted in a tweet, “So many Silicon Valley startups are about dudes wanting to replicate mom.” It’s also a symptom of how coding has evolved. — location: [2108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2108)

But this code doubled as a snooping device. If you were a Facebook user and logged into the site, any time you visited a page with a Like button on it, the button would tell Facebook where you’d been, even if you never clicked it. In effect, the galloping popularity of Like gave Facebook a neat way to build a mammoth dossier of every user’s surfing habits, across the entire web. — location: [2159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2159)

This belief in the unicorn programmer isn’t just a piece of pop culture. Indeed, in the real world of software, it’s so well known that the concept has a name: the “10X” coder. As the moniker suggests, it describes a programmer who is provably better, multiple times so, than the average code monkey. — location: [2231](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2231)

Tech firms, Brooks noted, were treating coding as if it were a form of manual labor, where you can speed something up by simply adding more workers. You need wheat to be picked twice as quickly? Easy: Add twice as many wheat pickers. But coding is an insight-based form of labor, more akin to writing a poem. Merely adding more people doesn’t help, because the solution to any problem is liable to come not from the sweat of many brows but from the lightning-strike aha moment of a single insightful individual. The upshot is that coding was literally the opposite of ditch digging, organizationally. Throwing more coders at an intractable problem can make things worse because it increases the amount of meetings and communication overhead. Brooks formulated this into a pithy koan: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later. — location: [2272](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2272)

The job is less “moving fast and creating” than patiently and gently fixing bugs in systems that otherwise more or less work. Andreessen remembers being at IBM as an intern in the early ’90s, where the company had a firm standard: “Ten lines of software code a day. Ten lines written, tested, debugged, documented—no more, and no less. Less than ten lines a day, and you were being lazy. More than ten lines a day, and you were being reckless.” — location: [2306](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2306)

Crowley noticed that inefficiency and wanted to make a tool that would connect not just his close friends but friends of friends, across all networks. They’d all read Harry Potter and knew of the “Marauder’s Map,” a magical document that showed everyone’s location in Hogwarts. — location: [2679](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2679)

It’s often noted that the first computer programmer ever was a woman: Ada Lovelace. — location: [2787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2787)

“We could diagnose troubles almost down to the individual vacuum tube,” as Jennings, one of the women, noted. “Since we knew both the application and the machine, we learned to diagnose troubles as well as, if not better than, the engineer.” — location: [2815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2815)

---
They designed some of the first “compilers.” — location: [2828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2828)

---
A coder could thus write the English-like code, and the compiler would do the hard work of turning it into 1s and 0s for the computer. Grace Hopper was wildly productive in this field, often credited as creating the first compiler, as well as the “FLOW-MATIC” language aimed at nontechnical businesspeople. — location: [2829](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2829)

they needed to promote coders to management; it didn’t feel right to be putting women in such important positions. — location: [2873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2873)

As sociologists have long noted, when a field suddenly becomes increasingly well paid and prominent, men who previously spurned it rush in: We’ll take this over now, ladies, thank you very much. — location: [2879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2879)

But that was the peak. From 1984 onward, the percentage slid downhill, slumping even more in the ’90s, such that by the time 2010 rolled around, it had been cut in half. Only 17.6 percent of the students in computer science programs were women. — location: [2896](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=2896)

“What I came to realize,” Gardner tells me, “is that it’s not that women are excluded. It’s that practically everyone is excluded if you’re not a young white man who’s single.” — location: [3092](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3092)

“One of the most disturbing things,” Roberts tells me, “was that we had a number of students who were majoring in computer science who hated the field. But they knew that was where their millions were coming from.” — location: [3119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3119)

So midcareer women in tech were leaving. Sick of years of that crap and not seeing it getting any better—indeed, seeing it getting worse—they voted with their feet. — location: [3136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3136)

When you have a homogenous cohort of people making software and hardware, they tend to produce work that works great for them—but can be useless, or even a disaster for people in other walks of life. — location: [3152](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07DBRNN1Z&location=3152)
