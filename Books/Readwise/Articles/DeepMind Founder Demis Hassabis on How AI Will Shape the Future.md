### Highlights

- I think what we’ve done with AlphaGo is introduce with the neural networks this aspect of intuition, if you want to call it that, and that’s really the thing that separates out top Go players: their intuition. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/700802935/2397879))
- I think that was quite an unexpected move. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/700802935/2397880))
- Well, the aggression and the audacity! Also, it played Lee Se-dol at his own game ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/700802935/2397883))
- I know Lee’s going to come back with a different strategy today ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/700802935/2398527))
- So Deep Blue is a hand-crafted program where the programmers distilled the information from chess grandmasters into specific rules and heuristics, whereas we’ve imbued AlphaGo with the ability to learn and then it’s learnt it through practice and study, which is much more human-like.

- What I’m really excited to use this kind of AI for is science, and advancing that faster. I’d like to see AI-assisted science where you have effectively AI research assistants that do a lot of the drudgery work and surface interesting articles, find structure in vast amounts of data, and then surface that to the human experts and scientists who can make quicker breakthroughs. I was giving a talk at CERN a few months ago; obviously they create more data than pretty much anyone on the planet, and for all we know there could be new particles sitting on their massive hard drives somewhere and no-one’s got around to analyzing that because there’s just so much data. So I think it’d be cool if one day an AI was involved in finding a new particle. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/700802935/2398666))
